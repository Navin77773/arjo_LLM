## <p>you don't need a market structure shift if you are using fair value gaps that is exactly a tweet that I sent out recently and a lot of people don't seem to understand what I'm trying to say now the most viewed reversal pattern or the most huge entry pattern is waiting for a marked structure shift that is the most used in SMC or even in general in the trading industry now I want you to understand that this is my specialty this is my baby because this is the basis of order flow this is something we go very in depth on inside my mentorship and the money making team aka the mentorship members exactly know what I'm talking about I also want you to understand that this was not thought to me the basics of fair value Gap a mark structure shift was taught to me by ICT so for that part all credits to him this manner of looking at a reversal pattern where you don't need a market structure shift I discovered this through my own studies just like a lot of concept that I'm teaching in the A to Z guide and all the concepts that I'm using in the mentorship this was not taught to me by anyone this was taught to me by myself and the reason I emphasize on that is because it's very important that you can do the exact same you can also make discoveries like this if you just put in the work and you submit to time and you study your ass off you need to be self-sustainable you can't always rely on someone else especially not if you want to be successful so in order for us to enter without a mark structure shift let's actually look at what a mark structure shift is first now there are a lot of variables in the market structure shift itself but the basic premise behind a mark structure shift is when we come into a discount array for example that low right there the first and most recent swing high so that is that swing high in this case if we trade back above that that is exactly a market structure ship as we talked about in the advanced Market structure video as well that is a short term high that gets taken right there and what does that lead to that leads to now potentially creating an intermediate term low if you remember 2022 ICT mentorship entry model it is a market structure shift with displacement of course I'm naming the very basics of it but to Mark structure shift with a displacement where we need to displace above the swing high so Above That Swing High we would need to see a display what is displacement defined a displacement is a fair value Gap our value Gap equals displacement displacement equals fair value Gap if you don't know the ICT 2022 mentorship model don't worry now what I'm going to be teaching you here is my own SD model St stands for sharp turn my own St model I'm first going over the highest probability entry pattern and the highest probability reversal pattern that will suit you most likely but I will also go over where you only need one bullish for Value Gap and you don't actually need a mark struck to shift at all where you can enter before a mark structure shift on just one single bullish fair value Gap or bearish traffic only if you combine the time frames correctly so how can we enter without needing to look at that marked structure shift right there well we can ignore all this to the left the only thing I want you to do is pay attention to what's happening on the right side of your chart the only thing relevant is that discount array once we trade into that discount array the only thing relevant so we remove everything here the only thing relevant is if we are having bullish fair value gaps higher if we have one bullish fair value Gap higher and we trade back into a discount array that can either be the bullish for Value Gap itself or a breaker that's sitting right there and then we have a new bullish for Value Gap higher so that's two displacements in a row it's a mechanical order displacement retracement displacement that exactly that is your highest probability entry pattern what can you do after that you can use the concepts of the previous episode to get to an entry with an overlapping period so that could be off of that breaker right there covering that low right there and targeting the highs right there the Drone liquidity now why am I picking this in hindsight this is all hindsight why are you ignoring the fact that on the weekly forecast the free weekly forecast that I had done this Sunday the 9th of July on YouTube We called out this exact move this exact sweep and this exact move higher aiming for those highs right there so no this wasn't picked out in hindsight we called this exact move again displacement retracement displacement that retracement needs to be into a discount array if you're looking of course to buy and displacement a displacement equals for Vega for Vi Gap equals displacement this right here is my St model but that is not all we can go even more advanced here we are on Euro GBP we are coming into a daily premium array right there ignoring everything that's on the left the only thing relevant is that daily premium array and then when you dive into the lower time frame go into the lower time frame and only look at the right side of your chart where's your first marker structure shift let's first Mark that out your first Mark start to shift is here where is the method we are using the St model it is this right there and then we have a new displacement lower right there that is exactly your St model now right here you likely wouldn't have got an entry but like I just mentioned there's a more advanced method to entering if you combine the time frames correctly you can enter on the first bearish fair value Gap right there that right there is exactly how you can enter without needing a market structure shift and how we sometimes have crazy accurate entries like that very early engine a little reminder if you don't combine the time frames correctly the best entry setup will always be when we have displacement retracement so right there and then new displacement so this entry right there and then using the overlapping PD Ray or entering just off of that verify Gap whatever you prefer with combining the time frame if you can manage to do that through your own study it can lead you to not needing a mark structure shift and only needing that bearish for Value Gap to enter right there this is something we go very in depth on in the mentorship Overflow is like my baby if you've paid close attention you would have already seen this but on ES can you notice that we had the exact same entry as on Euro GBP right there on that fair value Gap even before we have the market structure shift even before we have that entry right there we could have already been in right there now how accurate is that entry for you is that enough do you need more and it's not rocket science it's a mechanical step-by-step guide that you have to follow just like everything that I'm teaching here it's an if then if bullish for Value Gap enter if displacement higher retracement into discount array displacement higher enter I'm constantly using mechanical guidelines it's not random it's not whatever fits my narrative this whole move was called out beforehand using the concept that I'm teaching can you notice how beautifully practical that is now what is the logic with the method here with the SD model that I'm teaching why an SD model over just your Market structure shift well the SD model again it is two rules combined into one it is easier and it is stronger and the logic behind it is if price is ran by some sort of algorithm by financial institutions by Banks Etc and they have huge or orders what will happen in price price will displace price will displace what is displayed in again a fair value Gap price will show fair value gaps when we are coming off a premium or discount array price will show fair value gaps because the orders are so huge price will leave behind inefficiencies so what is more important the inefficiencies the fair value gaps or a marked structure shift the fair value gaps are the most important fair value gaps tell you the story and the fair value gaps telling you the story is exactly what we will go over as well in the next video on Friday it is not that market structure shift that's telling you a story it might be a Confluence but the main story is being told by the fair value gaps not the marks truck to shift alright USD Canadian dollar right here now the line you are seeing right there is a four hour premium array so why didn't I take this trade right there again you need context everything that you're doing you need context behind it so as well the reversal pattern that we're talking about here is of course fractal so the same reversal pattern can be applied on the higher time frame the St model is not only for your load time frame it is as well suitable for the higher time frame it can lead to your bias the SD model can lead to your bias we wait for that premium rate right there to be tapped into we tap into it right there now again ignoring everything that is to the left the only thing we need to see is a bearish vervi gap right there we have a potential bearish wagon there it is confirmed so what you would now do is you would Scout your marked execution on the on your other screen or wherever you have it on your phone maybe wherever your Market execution is ready to execute when we come into that fair value Gap all right we don't trade back into it but we have a new fair value Gap to work with so you would enter on this fair value Gap right there marked execution ready to execute on that fair value Gap we sting into that for Value Gap where's your stop loss above the potential intermediate term High targeting the future drone liquidity right there and that is my St model and you can notice right here where was your markstruct shift your mark start shift was right there again if you like this and this already blows your mind then come see what we have in store for you inside the mentorship because that will truly blow your mind how we are able to use this how we have already racked up 950k assets under management in four months four months of the mentorship being live and I don't want to take full credit for that because it is my students it is you it is everyone that is watching that is putting their trust in me and that is working their ass off so it's not me it's you that's making it work so thank you for that I owe you thank you thank you thank you for your support thank you for your trust this is only the beginning of order flow that you're seeing right here now if you like using the market structure shift then please go ahead and use it but I believe you are doing yourself a disservice by not using the SD model it makes life so much easier way more accurate higher probability what more do you want next on Friday we have the topic how fair value gaps tell story going even more in depth but if you want more advanced insights again the mentorship is the place to be perfect thank you [Music] thank you [Music]</p>

## <p>everyone can justify a trade ID but very little people actually know when to trade and on which days and weeks to get involved the people that know when to trade are the real professionals if you know when to trade you are ahead of 99 of your competition in order for us to be professionals there needs to be a boundary before we look at the chart just like there needs to be a boundary before we go into the lower time frame otherwise we can justify a trade ID every single day so to create a boundary we are going to go over low probability conditions and then also high probability conditions low probability conditions again when I talk about probabilities you need to remember I am truly talking about probabilities not a binary thing what I mean by that is a binary is it's on or off low probability there's a 20 chance on that day that you will win so there's still a chance that you will win but are the odds in your favor no high probability conditions are very easily summed up high probability conditions are clear one-sidedness now let's try to Define this if we are looking at gu right here and we are coming above that high right there clear one-sidedness is when you can only make arguments on one side of the market and you can watch the free weekly forecast because we exactly caught this move right there at that moment in time there are only bullish arguments to be made right there there is nothing from a probability standpoint there are no bearish arguments to be made right there from a probability standpoint there's no bearish fair value Gap lower there's not even a sweep of that high there's not an or block lower there's nothing bearish about that price action there are only bullish arguments to be made that is exactly when you want to be looking at the market or at any Market you are trading when there's clear one-sidedness so again clear one-sidedness is when you can make only arguments of one side of the market now is that going to be all the time no it's not and that's exactly why we have high probability conditions and low probability conditions in the first place it's not always going to be a high probability condition otherwise it wouldn't even be in high probability condition but in those high probability conditions you might have a win rate of maybe 80 90 with crazy returns because if you know where the weekly like this will expand then imagine how much profits you can make on the lower time frame by just knowing where the weekly will likely head towards a high probability condition like this based on price action alone will absolutely scream at you you don't have to force it when I went into the chart at this moment in time it only took two seconds for me to realize that is high probability condition and this is a general rule of thumb that I use in every major decision I need to take in Life or any small decision any decision you can think of if you need to convince yourself to do something then don't do it now how does that relate to trading if you need to convince yourself of certain price action then don't trade it because most likely you are forcing it and most likely that is not what you want to be trading if your intuition is taking over Etc then that setup will be so stupidly obvious whenever you get to whenever you're trying to get to a drama quickly the Drone liquidity should be so stupidly obvious like this especially after this candle after that down candle what will the next candle likely do it will move higher there's no bearish arguments right there to be made it's so stupidly obvious that this was the first draw liquidity so stupidly obvious so when you demand this off of price and price delivers exactly to your demands that is already high probability conditions so the highest probability condition is demanding something off of price and price doing exactly what you demonet off of it because then you already have set out in your mind certain guidelines that price needs to follow and you need to follow when price does deliver on that so you already have made up in your mind if price does this I do this so you have an if then there's no emotions in involved or whatever that is exactly what you want to have and that's the same premise when you open a chart and within the first five seconds you can already tell I like this that is exactly when you want to trade it because at that moment in time there are no emotions involved when you're trying to force it you're trying to force in low probability conditions there are emotion involved there's ego involved that is detrimental so I always tell my mentorship I can tell in 10 seconds whether I want to trade a certain instrument or not if there's nothing clear to me within that first 10 seconds then I don't like it again that's a general rule thumb for me 10 seconds is of course a bit of an exaggeration but one minute maximum if I can't get to clear draw liquidity within one minute then I don't trade it that's as simple as it is I don't force anything a similar scenario right here on USD Canadian dollar when we came into that Weekly fair value Gap right there overlapping with the mitigation block right there and we already had a huge rejection down then this next candle is so stupidly obvious that it wants to trade towards that swing low right there that is exactly the type of conditions that you want to have so low probability conditions are exactly the opposite of of course high probability conditions if you can't get to a clear drone liquidity there's no clear one-sidedness then you might have a 50 50 bias let's define a 50 50 bias a 50 50 bias is when you have both bullish arguments and bearish arguments whether you have 90 bullish arguments and 10 percent bearish arguments that is still low probability conditions high probability conditions is when you can only make arguments to one side of the market you want to have a hundred percent bullish arguments and a zero percent bearish arguments to take Longs for example right here on the dollar we had this as a drone liquidity and when we took out that drone liquidity we had an immediate rejection right there higher and based on the fair value gaps telling me a story video we know that this forward a block with that for Vega should ideally immediately push price lower and we shouldn't sweep that if we want to continue lower of course then afterwards what do we see we don't see a rejection lower we slowly climb lower we slowly climb higher so let's look at the arguments overall we have been bearish but we are sweeping that low we are not following through to the downside but overall we are bearish so right there we have around 70 bearish arguments and 30 bullish arguments that's a 50 50 bias that's not a high probability condition and you can see this PD array premium arrays right there not following through not showing fair value gaps lower and taking out that new low that leads to your Seek and Destroy conditions which is something we will go over more in depth in the next video as well when we look at this price action what tip we have we had an expansion right there going into a consolidation right there here the consolidation is a few candles this consolidation expansion consolidation concept also applies to only your singular candles so there's three candles consolidation expansion consolidation that consolidation creates your first candle of a potential fair value Gap that expansion creates the second candle of the potential fair value Gap the third candle will confirm the fair value Gap what do I mean by this when we look at this price action right here we have one two three that is the main premise behind it again that first consolidation can also be an expansion but it's being aware that this last candle right there that third candle that is the dangerous one because that one is unpredictable now the last general rule of thumb you need to use to identify low probability conditions is when we have had a major expansion to either side and we have taken a drama quality exactly what we're seeing here we have had expansion expansion expansion we have taken the draw liquidity that is exactly a low probability condition same for the most recent week when I'm recording this video actually we have taken that wrong Equity to the left in form of that low right there this right here was also low probability condition for me taking shorts right there was also low probability condition for me right there I would prefer taking Longs because we had a huge expansion and we had taken the drama quickly but again that is where you need to be careful that you are not trying to call a bottom so you wait for Clear bullish price action based on the higher time frame 4 hour and above when you're trying to chase price after a big expansion or trying to call about bottom or top that is exactly low probability conditions a few other low probability conditions for me are on the day itself trading ahead of CPI fomc and NFP because for me it usually consolidates ahead of that time ahead of that major news release of course we talked about the news events the other news events are perfectly fine they are tradable to me it's only CPI NFP and fomc if I want to trade on that day I want to trade after the news release trading ahead of those news events CPI NFP and fomc is low probability for my trading model it might not be low probability conditions for your trading model and that is where data comes in you collect data and over a hundred trade sample size you look at the trades and think all right from these 100 trades I can now gather great information on my low probability and higher probability conditions if I see my win rate is significantly lower trading ahead of CPI trading ahead of NFP or FMC then that exactly is your low probability condition but my data is not your data so that is where the difference comes in and that is where you need to do your own work because you have a unique individual trading model we went over high probability conditions and low probability conditions or trending models here this Seek and Destroy profile right there is someone's high probability because someone has a Seek and Destroy trading plan you either have a trending plan or seek any sort trading plan there's no in between and you only need one of them that is what I would advise focus on one of them so in the coming episodes we will exactly discuss how we can form a trading plan in Seek and Destroy conditions if you haven't watched the video on where we go in depth on news just yet I would highly advise to watch that video you can click on it right there alright perfect thank you [Music] thank you

bearish arguments that is still low probability conditions high probability conditions is when you can only make arguments to one side of the market you want to have a hundred percent bullish arguments and a zero percent bearish arguments to take Longs for example right here on the dollar we had this as a drone liquidity and when we took out that drone liquidity we had an immediate rejection right there higher and based on the fair value gaps telling me a story video we know that this forward a block with that for Vega should ideally immediately push price lower and we shouldn't sweep that if we want to continue lower of course then afterwards what do we see we don't see a rejection lower we slowly climb lower we slowly climb higher so let's look at the arguments overall we have been bearish but we are sweeping that low we are not following through to the downside but overall we are bearish so right there we have around 70 bearish arguments and 30 bullish arguments that's a 50 50 bias that's not a high probability condition and you can see this PD array premium arrays right there not following through not showing fair value gaps lower and taking out that new low that leads to your Seek and Destroy conditions which is something we will go over more in depth in the next video as well when we look at this price action what tip we have we had an expansion right there going into a consolidation right there here the consolidation is a few candles this consolidation expansion consolidation concept also applies to only your singular candles so there's three candles consolidation expansion consolidation that consolidation creates your first candle of a potential fair value Gap that expansion creates the second candle of the potential fair value Gap the third candle will confirm the fair value Gap what do I mean by this when we look at this price action right here we have one two three that is the main premise behind it again that first consolidation can also be an expansion but it's being aware that this last candle right there that third candle that is the dangerous one because that one is unpredictable now the last general rule of thumb you need to use to identify low probability conditions is when we have had a major expansion to either side and we have taken a drama quality exactly what we're seeing here we have had expansion expansion expansion we have taken the draw liquidity that is exactly a low probability condition same for the most recent week when I'm recording this video actually we have taken that wrong Equity to the left in form of that low right there this right here was also low probability condition for me taking shorts right there was also low probability condition for me right there I would prefer taking Longs because we had a huge expansion and we had taken the drama quickly but again that is where you need to be careful that you are not trying to call a bottom so you wait for Clear bullish price action based on the higher time frame 4 hour and above when you're trying to chase price after a big expansion or trying to call about bottom or top that is exactly low probability conditions a few other low probability conditions for me are on the day itself trading ahead of CPI fomc and NFP because for me it usually consolidates ahead of that time ahead of that major news release of course we talked about the news events the other news events are perfectly fine they are tradable to me it's only CPI NFP and fomc if I want to trade on that day I want to trade after the news release trading ahead of those news events CPI NFP and fomc is low probability for my trading model it might not be low probability conditions for your trading model and that is where data comes in you collect data and over a hundred trade sample size you look at the trades and think all right from these 100 trades I can now gather great information on my low probability and higher probability conditions if I see my win rate is significantly lower trading ahead of CPI trading ahead of NFP or FMC then that exactly is your low probability condition but my data is not your data so that is where the difference comes in and that is where you need to do your own work because you have a unique individual trading model we went over high probability conditions and low probability conditions or trending models here this Seek and Destroy profile right there is someone's high probability because someone has a Seek and Destroy trading plan you either have a trending plan or seek any sort trading plan there's no in between and you only need one of them that is what I would advise focus on one of them so in the coming episodes we will exactly discuss how we can form a trading plan in Seek and Destroy conditions if you haven't watched the video on where we go in depth on news just yet I would highly advise to watch that video you can click on it right there alright perfect thank you [Music] thank you [Music]

## <p>all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video we are going to be touching on swing highs and swing lows now of course there will be different insights as well around swing highs and swing lows and again it is very important here to keep an open mind so whenever I upload a video like I've mentioned before as well this is not only for beginners you will have great insights in my opinion of course if I do say so myself you will have great insights on swing highs andswing lows that you might not have heard before and it is about mastering those Basics that will get you to Mastery and that will in the end make you profitable that is very important so whenever there's a video about swing highs and swing lows for example there will be a lot of people that will think ah swing eyes and swing lows I already know it and when you are close-minded like that then in every aspect of life you will have a very difficult stage to actually learn and develop even more so now that I got my daily little message back intothe video we can get started alright so swing highs and swing lows what is a swing high and what is it swing low it is a three candle pattern so what do I mean by that if we take a look at this candle for example this up candle then to the left of that we have another op candle and to the right of that we have a down candle now in between what you will see is this Wick so we focus mainly on the Wicks right there this Wick is higher than the one to the right of it and higher than the one to the left of it once that down candle closes right thereonce that is closed this high is now a swing High so what you'll see is right here we also have a swing high this candle is higher the wick is higher than the wick to the left of it and to the right of it that makes a swing High one two three three candle pattern once the third candle closes then it is a confirmed swing high no you might have guessed if we turn it around so we invert it here we have one two three this Wick is lower than the one to the left of it and the one to the right of it so that is your swing low and righthere as well this Wick is lower than the one to the left foot and lower than the one to the right of it and here as well here as well those are all swing lows and that's the very basics of a swing low and a swing high and that's how we identify those swing highs and swing lows again a three candle pattern that's all there is to it so if we take another example right here this is a swing high right the candle of the collar doesn't really matter it is more so about the Wicks right here so that Wick is higherthan the Kendall to the left fit and then the candle to the right of it that is a swing high and this doesn't have to be an up candle then right here we have another swing High another swing high right here a swing low right here here we have another swing High another swing High swing low right there another sneaky little swing high right there I think you are probably getting the point right now alright so if we dive a little bit deeper into those swing highs and swing lows these swing highs and swinglows they are sometimes protected we use these swing highs and swing lows to see where price will likely navigate towards and to see which swing highs and swing lows are getting protected of course if swing lows are getting taken out so for example here majority of the Swing lows are getting taken out right here that is indicating that the trend is currently bearish and the swing highs right here are getting protected so when swing Highs are protected and Swinging lows are getting broken that is a very basicapproach of looking at bearish Market structure and when swing lows are getting protected and swing Highs are getting broken they are getting traded through then we have a very basic approach of looking at bullish Market structure so right here we can take a look at this Market structure right here and you can probably see we have a swing high right here this swing High didn't take out that swing High remember the kind of Premium array that is that is a swing failure see how it is now making more sense sothis swing high is protected now this swing high is protected then we have a small swing high right here created that is Swing high is getting taken out take note of that note that that swing high is getting taken out then this swing high is now being protected then we have another swing High here another swing High here they are both getting taken out why take note of it I'm going to answer the question in just a few minutes so right here we have the actual protected High then here we have a new protected swing Highhere we have a new protected swing high and now we are continuing down and then we have reached the draw liquidity AKA where we expect price to trade to and then you will see alright price starts to shift now and these highs that were protected earlier are not that protected anymore so let's get back to the thing I just mentioned why are these swing highs getting taken swing highs should be protected right well there's a very simple and overlooked method that I use if we just zoom out a little bit and go on to the 15 minute time framesee what I just did and see what just happened see how this makes a lot more sense we are reaching into something on a time frame above it so this is where I will always mention the time frame you are trading on should always be in context of the time frame above it there is a go-to sentence that you'll hear me mention a lot of the time if you are trading the 5 minutes for example it should always be in context of the 15 minute if you're taking the 15 minute it should be in context of the one hour if you're turning the one hourit should be in context of the four hour so on and so on and so on so right here that premium array on a 15 minute will have a stronger magnet then on a five minute so five minutes swing highs and swing lows will likely not be protected when there is a swing High that is hovering just below a premium array that is on a higher time frame than the time frame we are looking at for That Swing high so for example right here we have a 15 minute fair value Gap right there then if we drop down into the five minute we have see that swing high is actuallyperfectly making that verify Gap That Swing high on the five minute is actually the fair value Gap low it is the same low as that we just saw of the 15 minute we take a look right here this high this eye of that candle the wick high right there is the swing high on the 5 minute can you now see why a lot of people get aligned sided on the lower time frame and they are thinking oh we took a swing High well we took a swing high so right here we have an entry right there because price took a swing high so now we have bullish Market structure nothat's not how it works and I get it because when you first get taught this stuff then you think all right marks as you Chef so the trends should change now right not quite and this is one of the few tricks so right here you can see as well that is why these swing highs didn't hold because on the time frame above it we were creating a premium rate that we sting into it and then we drop and you will obviously see the same on the one minute time frame but right here you will have a lot of Swing lows andyou can get easily blindsided right here and think all right well we have clear bullish Trend right here let me take an entry right there oh I took a loss and when you're trading like this in my opinion you are trading absolute with a blindfold on every time frame needs to be in context of the time frame above it when you have that you will not have mistakes like these so can you now see why I said in the beginning of the video that what seems like a very basic video is not a very basic video so there isanother thing right we just went over these swing Highs but what happened here we have a lot of Swing highs that just got taken and all of a sudden we drop down again why are we dropping down when clearly the 15-minute Market structure right here is bullish we are taking swing highs we are protecting swing lows aryo just literally told me that if swing Highs are getting taken and swing lows are being protected that a market structure is bullish what the what is going on and this will often you will and you will come across a social mediainfluence or gurus on Instagram on Twitter on YouTube that will tell you and that will sell you a fancy turtle soup entry right here how can we know that it took all these swing highs and then just stopped right there and then it went lower how can we know well let's apply the same logic that we just did on the 5 minute and the 15 minute time frame let's zoom out if we go on to the Daily right here what do we see previous day high that is liquidity above that previous Ai and then what a fair value Gap a dailyfair value Gap aiming for what a daily fair value Gap right there can you see now what I'm aiming at can you see what I'm trying to tell you so on the 15 minute you will get absolutely blindsided right here but if we apply the plot that we talked about in a previous video on The Daily we will already see this coming isn't that absolutely beautiful because first line of defense what's your first line of defense fair value Gap right there daily verified again so on the 15 minute we will not get blindsided and this mightseem like a lot of liquidity but the only thing that is relevant to us is that daily fair value get right there and then right here these swing highs get protected until we reach the opposite draw on liquidity an opposing discount array oh this is absolutely beautiful right um and this is only the start I'm very excited to to already start the next video but you could probably tell how passionate I am trying to teach this stuff this is absolutely beautiful in my opinion so on that note I want you to study this untilFriday and by the way if you want to be attending the live streams you are always welcome we always have a little chat in the live streams if you want to be updated on that then do join the free telegram the link is in the description and you will be up to date with the live stream schedule as well that is where I dive into this stuff a little bit deeper of course if you want an even deeper Insight then my mentorship is always available masterclass enrollments are currently closed but again if you want to get updated on that as well then dojoin my free Telegram link is in the description so study this and this will be very beneficial to you when we dive into it deeper on Friday so I will see you at the next video on Friday alright take care thank you foreign [Music]</p>

## <p>all right so we are going to be talking about swing projections how we can know the high and low of the day how we can know the high and low of a session how we can know the high and low of a week and how we can know the high and low of that particular month even so this is going to be a very strong tool that you can use now it is very important to understand that we first touched on the Judo swing and the power 3 the manipulation accumulation and distribution knowing that is very important because we know the Judas swing is that manipulation part of your power 3 right so all these episodes are in Harmony when you have that due to swing that Judas ring that manipulation part is exactly the part where you want to potentially draw your swing projections from so what do I actually mean by that or a session so where will a session likely reach or what can we actually talk Target well right here we have a London session the London session starts right there and it ends right there in between that London session what we touched on is you have a manipulation part accumulation part and you have a distribution all right from this part all that is moving down right here this swing why is that a swing well we are moving from That Swing High to That Swing Low this is a swing it is moving into a fair value Gap right there again using the flood and the lot first line of defense right there last line of defense right there a very logical move right there right so this Judas swing this manipulation part you would take your Fibonacci right there you draw it from That Swing Low right there to that swing High I'm sorry to interrupt the 0.62 you are seeing so the minus 0.62 that one is supposed to be 0.68 I messed it up with my Fibonacci settings and I noticed it in the edit so sorry about that it is supposed to be 0.68 all right let's continue then the Fibonacci settings are one to zero in between that you have nothing but on the minus side you have minus 0.27 minus 0.62 minus 1 a symmetrical swing point right there minus 1.62 and minus 2 a double symmetrical swing Point these levels is what price can reach for especially in this particular session right there what we would do here is you would want to make sure that you zoom out again you zoom out a little and right here you see all right we have a nice order block right there with verify Gap even potentially that high lining up with swing projections so when premium arrays Target right there are lining up with swing projections those are exactly what you want to Target so this is giving you a perfect indication of which premium arrays you want to Target so in this case we can use the order block right there the one the minus one level the symmetrical swing level that could be a great Earth take profit and afterwards if it does move aggressively through this we can now look to potentially aim for this level and that level and right here it reached even higher on this particular day now how can we know it reaches even higher right there we had this London session right here right now notice I am now drawing it from the bodies to the bodies not using the Wicks here and the reason for that is very much based off of volatility so how much do you expect the market to move and as well play around with it when you play around with this and you first go over the bodies then you go over using two weeks and you see which one of them is more aligning with premium or discount arrays so here I'm using the bodies right there from the London low to the London high and now I want to zoom out again and see which levels are overlapping with premium arrays alright a zoom out on a four hour can we see something yes right here what do we see we have a fair value Gap right there when you see this when you see these levels right there and you see that fair value gap on the four hour and overall of course the bias was still bearish can we now logically expect for it to reach into that -2 and then drop off it might happen but is it very logical of course not because we have a fair value Gap sitting right there and why do we use that Fairfax again first line of defense so right there all right we have an indication it can reach into that four hour five Gap so now we have somewhat of an indication what the sessions can reach for but what can the day actually reach for well if we go over the steps again so how can we know where to draw our measured swing projections we need to have first a judo swing or a manipulation part of that power three so right here the day opened right here midnight open that is your reference point everything above that that is your manipulation that is your Judas swing you draw it from this high to that low right there does this line up with a nice Target well first we have a few fair value gaps to start below that low of course there's a few fair value gaps to Target here this one and this one and then right here in between those two fair value gaps we have the 0.27 level so is there a chance that we will sting internet lower for that Gap yes there is there's a logical chance that that will happen and then at the right time of day because right here what happens London close starts if London close starts right there and we already reached into debt and we haven't displaced any lower and we already moved a lot of Pips so we already moved a lot of Pips up a lot of Pips down now we are arriving at London close right there which we know will likely cap the day based off of the daily profiles we talked about is it now logical to say we will continue lower until 0.62 not really yes it can happen but what you'll see is if we leave this one right there if we leave it on what happens 0.62 is perfectly overlapping with what this low right there which is also what the previous week low and a weekly fair value Gap alright that is a very logical Target for us so I think we might want to Target that but now we are getting closer to what we are getting closer to targeting something on a weekly so if we want to know what will we likely reach for on a weekly basis what do we use we just use daily profiles and daily power 3. now we want to use weekly power 3 and the weekly profiles so what is a weekly profile again remember Monday Tuesday Tuesday likely high of the week or Wednesday high of the week then you have the opposing move that is exactly what we want to see so from Monday where does Monday start AKA where is the week start right there the week starts Monday midnight open is is what I use right there so everything Above This level right there what is that that is your manipulation that is your power of three so this again you want to grab that Fibonacci too drawed from that high to that low again you can use the Wicks here see which one lines up nicely with a discount rate the bodies here you can see it already lines up it is not hindsight thing it just lines up better because there is a weekly verify Gap sitting right there so these right here is what you can use as targets the 0.27 first and then afterwards 0.62 and if there's a weekly verify Gap sitting right there previous week low as well is it now logical that we will reach for that symmetrical swing point right there but in my opinion it's not if we reach for that I believe we might even continue lower why is that well based on the weekly fair value gaps and based on the flood and the lot where will we likely continue higher off of off of that Weekly for fight so we will likely see a rejection there once we reach into that right there we reach into that Weekly verify Gap into that level on this Friday we have Thank God It's Friday setup what is the Judas swing on this Friday midnight open is right there low high symmetrical swaying point right there overlapping with what a beautiful one hour order block right there fair value Gap what more do you want so for a Thank God It's Friday setup that you potentially took right there what can the day what can Friday reach for also using this concept so now what is the next step or in your routine in your analysis your actual first step a monthly analysis so where does the month start here here we have Monday of May then we have this move up and we continue lower right there your Judo swing where is it your Judo swing in other words is your manipulation part of the power 3 where's your manipulation part of the power 3 on the monthly candle right there if we zoom out of course it is that part that Wick right so on The Daily it is everything that is above that Monday right there on the 1st of May so that right there is your duty swing where's your actual swing right there now for this month what does it line up with well first we line up with a few lows right there but what I always like is I like to aim for fair value gaps because you need to remember price is either taking liquidity or it is rebalancing something right here there's nothing to rebalance anymore because already everything has already been rebalanced so if there's nothing to rebalance what will it do it will take liquidity but when it takes liquidity what would likely do it will reach into something to rebalance after taking that liquidity so you could make the argument price is always rebalancing because after taking this liquidity what does it reach into that fair value and that is exactly what we had outlined in the weekly forecast leading up to this price action don't believe me watch the previous weekly forecast and you will exactly see what we were talking about during the month of May we exactly had this as our Target so for this may month we now now have this level overlapping with a beautiful rare value Gap right there and that's exactly what I would want to see a fair value Gap I I personally always love to Target Fair Value gaps so once I see this overlapping with a fair value Gap perfect that's it then what do we see after the next month where does it start May ends here alright June starts right there then we have this little down movement and then we continue a higher right there so this is our manipulation part right this is our Judas swing they're right there what do we see well first off we reach for that -2 level that doubles symmetrical swing right there but what do we reach for again a beautiful fair value Gap sitting right there on the daily which is also a fair value Gap right there on the weekly and even more refined there's an old block sitting right there that is exactly your monthly Target if you already have the monthly Target see how many days you are able to capitalize on it that is absolutely beautiful so for your swing projection you want to make sure that your swing projections are an indication of where price might reach for but the PD arrays will tell you exactly in combination with those swing projections what it will likely reach for because for example we also had this for Value right we also had that tiny fair value Gap right there and we did reach for it perfect but it is the 14th of June based on the power of three do you think the monthly candle will stop right there and then just consolidate doesn't make sense right it's only the 14th of June we're halfway through that month the meat is in the middle the same for a weekly candle right you wouldn't expect Wednesday to already make the opposing end of the week no the meat is in the middle that's where the trend is that is where we want to continue so that is very important to understand alright here we are on yes and I just want to go over the indices as well the future because it's a little bit different you don't use the same swing projections you use standard deviations what are standard deviations so if we again draw the Fibonacci and we draw it on this lag for example right there you would now have symmetrical swing points and half of that so it's constantly 0.5 0 to 5 added onto that minus one zero to five added onto that minus 1.5 and it stops at -3 this is your standard deviations why is this well that is because yes Futures in general indices are way more volatile so that is where you would use these standard deviations instead of the measured swing projections so for example why did I draw it on this leg down down well it's an obvious leg down of course but there's a reason behind it right here what do we see this is Monday Monday starts right there everything below that right there is your Judo swing for what or that Weekly profile so first off we have this lag Down AKA are due to swing on a weekly profile basis then right there we have a 0 to 5 level which already overlaps with fair value gaps right there that's what I love so this Tuesday reaches into that first and as a retracement but for the weekly profile it is only a Tuesday we are not done yet and after that we have Wednesday we have Thursday and Friday huge expansion higher reaching for 2.5 with of course an overlapping opposing premium array right there that is exactly what we would want to see and yes of course we could first have this Target in mind that fair value Gap right there with the symmetrical swing point right there but if we don't respect this if we don't show signs of respect aka the rejecting video that we touched on then what is the next thing that we can reach for that high now if we dive a little bit deeper into this we have this high this breaker block right there with an overlapping farewell Gap right there and now dropping down into the 15 minutes what do we see we first off have this Judo swing this fake move before you reach into that so this big move is already where you can draw your Fibonacci on right there almost symmetrical swing point but the main premise behind it again this is overlapping with what it's overlapping with that high right there that breaker block once we reach that what was the Judo swing leading into that move this right there what is this overlapping with that high right there so what is a logical Target that high once you get in here for example just keep in mind that we have that hype of course on the higher time frame we still have way more to aim for but if you're scalping on a one minute time frame is it logical to have a daily Target not really so if you sculpt this on the one minute time frame you might want to consider taking profits right there and getting break even now listen up you made it to the end so I'm here to reward you don't worry I'm looking out for you if you made it to the end I'm here to reward you so I want you to go to the link in the description the oreo.io to my website once you are on my website if you scroll down a little bit below the my mentorship there is an email which you can fill in there's an email list that you can join that email list is where I will be sending more studies more breakdowns trades that I took during a week and very important updates so if you made it to the end of this video you are now being rewarded so great job of making to the end you should thank yourself elf go there fill your name fill your email address and then you will be receiving soon very important updates very interesting topics that we can study and even more educational content keep an eye out for that and I will of course see you at 8 30 on Sunday with our weekly forecast and our q a perfect thank you [Music]</p>

all right so we are going to be talking about swing projections how we can know the high and low of the day how we can know the high and low of a session how we can know the high and low of a week and how we can know the high and low of that particular month even so this is going to be a very strong tool that you can use now it is very important to understand that we first touched on the Judo swing and the power 3 the manipulation accumulation and distribution knowing that is very important because we know the Judas swing is that manipulation part of your power 3 right so all these episodes are in Harmony when you have that due to swing that Judas ring that manipulation part is exactly the part where you want to potentially draw your swing projections from so what do I actually mean by that or a session so where will a session likely reach or what can we actually talk Target well right here we have a London session the London session starts right there and it ends right there in between that London session what we touched on is you have a manipulation part accumulation part and you have a distribution all right from this part all that is moving down right here this swing why is that a swing well we are moving from That Swing High to That Swing Low this is a swing it is moving into a fair value Gap right there again using the flood and the lot first line of defense right there last line of defense right there a very logical move right there right so this Judas swing this manipulation part you would take your Fibonacci right there you draw it from That Swing Low right there to that swing High I'm sorry to interrupt the 0.62 you are seeing so the minus 0.62 that one is supposed to be 0.68 I messed it up with my Fibonacci settings and I noticed it in the edit so sorry about that it is supposed to be 0.68 all right let's continue then the Fibonacci settings are one to zero in between that you have nothing but on the minus side you have minus 0.27 minus 0.62 minus 1 a symmetrical swing point right there minus 1.62 and minus 2 a double symmetrical swing Point these levels is what price can reach for especially in this particular session right there what we would do here is you would want to make sure that you zoom out again you zoom out a little and right here you see all right we have a nice order block right there with verify Gap even potentially that high lining up with swing projections so when premium arrays Target right there are lining up with swing projections those are exactly what you want to Target so this is giving you a perfect indication of which premium arrays you want to Target so in this case we can use the order block right there the one the minus one level the symmetrical swing level that could be a great Earth take profit and afterwards if it does move aggressively through this we can now look to potentially aim for this level and that level and right here it reached even higher on this particular day now how can we know it reaches even higher right there we had this London session right here right now notice I am now drawing it from the bodies to the bodies not using the Wicks here and the reason for that is very much based off of volatility so how much do you expect the market to move and as well play around with it when you play around with this and you first go over the bodies then you go over using two weeks and you see which one of them is more aligning with premium or discount arrays so here I'm using the bodies right there from the London low to the London high and now I want to zoom out again and see which levels are overlapping with premium arrays alright a zoom out on a four hour can we see something yes right here what do we see we have a fair value Gap right there when you see this when you see these levels right there and you see that fair value gap on the four hour and overall of course the bias was still bearish can we now logically expect for it to reach into that -2 and then drop off it might happen but is it very logical of course not because we have a fair value Gap sitting right there and why do we use that Fairfax again first line of defense so right there all right we have an indication it can reach into that four hour five Gap so now we have somewhat of an indication what the sessions can reach for but what can the day actually reach for well if we go over the steps again so how can we know where to draw our measured swing projections we need to have first a judo swing or a manipulation part of that power three so right here the day opened right here midnight open that is your reference point everything above that that is your manipulation that is your Judas swing you draw it from this high to that low right there does this line up with a nice Target well first we have a few fair value gaps to start below that low of course there's a few fair value gaps to Target here this one and this one and then right here in between those two fair value gaps we have the 0.27 level so is there a chance that we will sting internet lower for that Gap yes there is there's a logical chance that that will happen and then at the right time of day because right here what happens London close starts if London close starts right there and we already reached into debt and we haven't displaced any lower and we already moved a lot of Pips so we already moved a lot of Pips up a lot of Pips down now we are arriving at London close right there which we know will likely cap the day based off of the daily profiles we talked about is it now logical to say we will continue lower until 0.62 not really yes it can happen but what you'll see is if we leave this one right there if we leave it on what happens 0.62 is perfectly overlapping with what this low right there which is also what the previous week low and a weekly fair value Gap alright that is a very logical Target for us so I think we might want to Target that but now we are getting closer to what we are getting closer to targeting something on a weekly so if we want to know what will we likely reach for on a weekly basis what do we use we just use daily profiles and daily power 3. now we want to use weekly power 3 and the weekly profiles so what is a weekly profile again remember Monday Tuesday Tuesday likely high of the week or Wednesday high of the week then you have the opposing move that is exactly what we want to see so from Monday where does Monday start AKA where is the week start right there the week starts Monday midnight open is is what I use right there so everything Above This level right there what is that that is your manipulation that is your power of three so this again you want to grab that Fibonacci too drawed from that high to that low again you can use the Wicks here see which one lines up nicely with a discount rate the bodies here you can see it already lines up it is not hindsight thing it just lines up better because there is a weekly verify Gap sitting right there so these right here is what you can use as targets the 0.27 first and then afterwards 0.62 and if there's a weekly verify Gap sitting right there previous week low as well is it now logical that we will reach for that symmetrical swing point right there but in my opinion it's not if we reach for that I believe we might even continue lower why is that well based on the weekly fair value gaps and based on the flood and the lot where will we likely continue higher off of off of that Weekly for fight so we will likely see a rejection there once we reach into that right there we reach into that Weekly verify Gap into that level on this Friday we have Thank God It's Friday setup what is the Judas swing on this Friday midnight open is right there low high symmetrical swaying point right there overlapping with what a beautiful one hour order block right there fair value Gap what more do you want so for a Thank God It's Friday setup that you potentially took right there what can the day what can Friday reach for also using this concept so now what is the next step or in your routine in your analysis your actual first step a monthly analysis so where does the month start here here we have Monday of May then we have this move up and we continue lower right there your Judo swing where is it your Judo swing in other words is your manipulation part of the power 3 where's your manipulation part of the power 3 on the monthly candle right there if we zoom out of course it is that part that Wick right so on The Daily it is everything that is above that Monday right there on the 1st of May so that right there is your duty swing where's your actual swing right there now for this month what does it line up with well first we line up with a few lows right there but what I always like is I like to aim for fair value gaps because you need to remember price is either taking liquidity or it is rebalancing something right here there's nothing to rebalance anymore because already everything has already been rebalanced so if there's nothing to rebalance what will it do it will take liquidity but when it takes liquidity what would likely do it will reach into something to rebalance after taking that liquidity so you could make the argument price is always rebalancing because after taking this liquidity what does it reach into that fair value and that is exactly what we had outlined in the weekly forecast leading up to this price action don't believe me watch the previous weekly forecast and you will exactly see what we were talking about during the month of May we exactly had this as our Target so for this may month we now now have this level overlapping with a beautiful rare value Gap right there and that's exactly what I would want to see a fair value Gap I I personally always love to Target Fair Value gaps so once I see this overlapping with a fair value Gap perfect that's it then what do we see after the next month where does it start May ends here alright June starts right there then we have this little down movement and then we continue a higher right there so this is our manipulation part right this is our Judas swing they're right there what do we see well first off we reach for that -2 level that doubles symmetrical swing right there but what do we reach for again a beautiful fair value Gap sitting right there on the daily which is also a fair value Gap right there on the weekly and even more refined there's an old block sitting right there that is exactly your monthly Target if you already have the monthly Target see how many days you are able to capitalize on it that is absolutely beautiful so for your swing projection you want to make sure that your swing projections are an indication of where price might reach for but the PD arrays will tell you exactly in combination with those swing projections what it will likely reach for because for example we also had this for Value right we also had that tiny fair value Gap right there and we did reach for it perfect but it is the 14th of June based on the power of three do you think the monthly candle will stop right there and then just consolidate doesn't make sense right it's only the 14th of June we're halfway through that month the meat is in the middle the same for a weekly candle right you wouldn't expect Wednesday to already make the opposing end of the week no the meat is in the middle that's where the trend is that is where we want to continue so that is very important to understand alright here we are on yes and I just want to go over the indices as well the future because it's a little bit different you don't use the same swing projections you use standard deviations what are standard deviations so if we again draw the Fibonacci and we draw it on this lag for example right there you would now have symmetrical swing points and half of that so it's constantly 0.5 0 to 5 added onto that minus one zero to five added onto that minus 1.5 and it stops at -3 this is your standard deviations why is this well that is because yes Futures in general indices are way more volatile so that is where you would use these standard deviations instead of the measured swing projections so for example why did I draw it on this leg down down well it's an obvious leg down of course but there's a reason behind it right here what do we see this is Monday Monday starts right there everything below that right there is your Judo swing for what or that Weekly profile so first off we have this lag Down AKA are due to swing on a weekly profile basis then right there we have a 0 to 5 level which already overlaps with fair value gaps right there that's what I love so this Tuesday reaches into that

## <p>all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to the second video we are going to talk about mitigation blocks so I hope everyone has done their homework I hope everyone has studied order blocks then the next thing for you to do after this video up until Tuesday 8 30 a.m when we talk about next topic study the mitigation block and the order block so study both things you might notice that you like one of them more than the other so you might like order blocks more you might like mitigation blocks more that'sperfectly fine you don't need to know everything in order to be profit find the thing you like and run away with it then as well this Sunday 8 30 am the 7th of May I'm going to be doing a live stream here on YouTube I'll have a reminder in my telegram link is in the description and we are going to be mainly going over mindset Etc because I feel like a lot of people have been struggling the past few weeks and that's exactly what I want to touch on alright now let's dive straight into it so for a mitigation block I havethese few structured steps right here the first one is pattern the second one is a low slash High the third one is overlapping now of course the steps won't make any sense if you don't watch the videos and that's the purpose of them so if we take a look at the first step the first step is pattern now the first thing I want you to acknowledge and this is very simple you don't need a lot of knowledge for you to understand this pattern the first pattern is basically we have a down move just a down movethen we have another up move this up move fails to take out this high this is a swing High swing High swing low will touch on it in a later topic this low this swing low fails to take out this swing high and then we see another rejection lower this is a swing failure again that's something we'll touch on in later videos as well so don't worry this pattern is called a swing failure pattern now what this swing filler pattern creates is a mitigation block so right here if we trade back into this lowthere is our mitigation block and then we continue lower now the third one is overlapping overlapping is indicating at this mitigation block there's another premium array in this case premium array because remember we're going lower we are looking at premium arrays there's another premium array overlapping with the mitigation block so that could be a fair value Gap here but that could also be what we learned in the first episode an order Block in this leg right before we take out the low there might be a little bearish orderblock right here overlapping with the mitigation block and that makes two premium Rays that's double as strong as one mitigation block alone so right here we have the pattern we have our swing failure pattern so write that down it's a swing failure pattern the next thing is the low in this case the low slash high if we turn this thing around we have the same exact thing we have the pattern right here we have the high and then we continue higher now you might say this is support and resistance well yes you're not wrong but the thing thatmakes it so strong is the logic behind find it and the thing why support and resistance sometimes works is because you'll see this exact pattern now the logic behind it is if if we are moving lower there will be buyers right here in this low and they will buy this leg up now once we move lower and we retrace back up to this low then the buyers the buyers in this leg have a chance to mitigate their buy orders AKA take a loss Etc or take a break even and then price is able to continue lower so for example let's say we are retailTraders and I don't mean retail as in the individual Trader I mean retails in the retail Concepts the support and resistance concept let's say we saw some nice support right here and we are buying this alright we're getting a rally perfect now we drop down immediately we're in drawdown now the next thing price retraces back to our entry we are able to mitigate that order and we can close it Earthly fine now there might be some traders that got in right here and then they take a little bit of a net lossperfect and that's what we need this liquidity for price to move now like I said in the previous episode we need for every buyer we need a seller for every seller we need a buyer now does that mean that Average Joe behind his monitor is getting taken out of the market because his five Lots is what the central banks and the institutions need no so if you ever see someone saying oh the market is hunting me well you're you're 100 Lots don't really matter we are talking about institutions that aretrading retail Concepts so the big big big boys not your neighbor that's putting 100 Lots on gold no that's not relevant and that's important to acknowledge because a lot of people think they are getting hunted by the market just because they placed an order this is not necessarily true now if you place an order on a b Book Broker open up the spreads they take you out and then it continues that's what happens a lot of the time on a b Book Broker so if you choose a broker I'm not here for youto use my affiliate link and go to my broker that's not what I'm doing here do your own research and make sure you're not trading on a b Book Broker not Financial advice as well first practice in demo and Brokers is something we can get into later on alright with this bit of the logic behind it Etc now of course make your own logic if this logic is not completely true perfectly fine if it works for you then it works for you and that's all that matters so if there's someone on Twitter that's telling you noyou don't have the right logic just tell them thank you for your opinion I'm going to do my own thing no need to get into an argument or anything we just focus on ourselves here all right now let's take a look at some live examples right here let me remove these things so the first one can you notice the first one right here it's the same exact pattern that we just had it's right here notice this down move the retracement up this low fails to take out this high then we have a swing failure the swingthis swing up pills to take out this High a swing failure we continue lower and then we have a slight retracement right here into what your mitigation block right here now let me remove the lines just to make it a bit more clearer and where do we take the mitigation block the low slash High we are bearish so we take the low of the mitigation block this can be the absolute low of the wick doesn't have to be the body so right here boom and again you can apply the same logic if you want to if that Wick isn'toverlapping with a fair value Gap then you take the body if the wick is overlapping with a further Gap then you take the wick that's up to you those minor differences that's a little personal preference just because you select the wick or the body is not going to make you a millionaire all of a sudden that's not what it's about and that's what a lot of people think right they they think oh is he is he selecting the body or is he selecting a wick just do what you prefer just because he selected the wick or the body that's notgoing to be a major Game Changer but again if you want to make it easy for yourself stick to the rule if the wick is overlapping with a profile Gap then take the wick if the wick isn't overlapping with a verify Gap then take the body alright but the last step right here is number three overlapping and again if you don't know what a fair value Gap is just yet perfectly fine because then later these videos will make even more sense when you re-watch them not if when you re-watch this video so the overlapping if you know what afavorite cup is what's overlapping with this mitigation block a fair value Gap and this is exactly what makes the mitigation block so strong and other PD arrays as well when there's something overlapping right here we have a fair value Gap and this is what makes it so so strong and this is as well for the advanced Traders when we notice this pattern price doesn't have to come all the way back up into here this is already fair value or price to continue lower and that's exactly when a mitigation block is sostrong and this is how I like to trade mitigation only when there's something overlapping preferably a fair value Gap alright so let's take a look at some more examples and some bullish examples as well so right here we have a bullish example and again if you do feel like it it's perfectly fine to pause the video and try to spot the mitigation block or any other block beforehand and before I touch on it this way you will learn faster alright so we have the pattern right here we have this big up moveright here we have this down move this I fails to take out this low and even this low continues higher which creates a mitigation block now it's very important for you to acknowledge and this is as well for you to write down it's a swing failure and write down as well it's not a breaker pattern now you might not know what a breaker pattern is just yet but it's a different sort of thing there's a swing failure and a breaker better write it down come back to it later on when we touch on Breaker blocks and then it willmake more sense so it's essential for us that we have this big move up first and then a high that fails to take out the low continue higher which creates the high a mitigation block now in this case if we do apply that rule let's then take the body instead again personal preference if you want to stick to that rule then perfectly fine stick to the rule the thing is on this High we take the up candle of the mitigation block so here we take the up candle just like we saw on the previous example when it's abearish mitigation block we take the down candle now what is overlapping see this right here there's an overlapping fair value Gap with that mitigation block and that's exactly what I like so much about mitigation block combined with a perfect Gap or as you'll see in another example combined with a border block as well alright so here we have another example now it gets interesting and again these things are not rocket science they are very simple structured easy steps trading is not a rocket science and it'snot supposed to be if we can keep it simple and there's a reason why we keep it simple and that's what I touch on a lot in the mentorship there's a specific reason why we keep things simple and why it's so so so important now if we take a look at this mitigation block right here we have the pattern the swing fill your pattern we have the high and we have something overlapping see what's overlapping it's an order block at the mitigation block and a verify Gap that's three discount arrays at the sameexact spot remember that because that's important the more overlapping PD arrays are at one spot the stronger the defense is so right here we take the up candle because it's a bullish mitigation block the mitigation Block in itself is overlapping with a fair value Gap and then just below that fair value Gap we have this order block as well remember what an order block is remember the steps of getting to an order block this is the exact steps and this is what makes a mitigation block so super strong all right now let's take a look at onemore example and then you're going to head into your own chart and do your own work as always remember if you don't do the work yourself then these videos will always just be some sort of entertainment for you watching videos without integrating the stuff and without working on it is just entertainment nothing more alright so right here we have another example and you can see how I'm using different time frames because this is a fractal thing every one of these topics is completely correct now the higher time frame thehigher the time frame we use the stronger the PD Ray so if we're looking at a weekly right now this will be stronger than a daily or a four hour video why the biggest orders are on the biggest time frames and if we know this effect then why not focus on the higher time frame and understanding the higher time frame because that's where the real orders are of Institutions etc etc so again the same exact pattern swing fill your pattern this High fills to take out this low we move higher after this high and this is what you'll see a lot rightafter we take the high and we close above it we have a fair value Gap right here overlapping with the high or an order block like we just saw and we move back into the mitigation block with the overlapping discount array we move higher now remember what I said this happens a lot when we close Above This High close not wicking the high and then we have a short-term return and then we push even higher so a lot of people say we have this mitigation block right here we have the swing filler pattern right here and now we're coming back all theway down would you still use the mitigation block no I personally wouldn't I would look at something on the higher time frame but from what I can see this mitigation block has already been used we've already traded back into it short term here this was our opportunity right now we just wait for new price action so we take the low slash the high in this case we take the high obviously overlapping or width of your value Gap and we push higher again swing for the pattern we close above it and that's a little golden nervous foryou if you made it to the end we close above it then we have a short term return another little Golden Nugget for you you're getting rewards for if you stay to the end of these videos and then we rarely hire close short-term return rally higher then we have the swing filler pattern the high in this case because it's a bullish mitigation block and it's overlapping with a verify gap or like we just saw on the previous example overlapping with an order block or another Discounter alright now for you I want you to study this on your ownI want you to make up your own logic of it I want to see if you can make up your own pattern of it so if you recognize a few things that happen over and over and over and over when these mitigation blocks hold but also look at a few mitigation blocks see if you can spot them that failed is obviously not every mitigation block will hold even if they are as clean as this one and that's the reality of trading all right I want to thank you quick reminder live stream on YouTube right here this Sunday 8 30 a.mNew York eastern time and we are going to talk about the mindset the Trader's mindset the champion mindset and the next video on the A to Z guide is obviously Tuesday 8 30 am New York eastern time as well alright thank you and make sure to do the work thank you thank you foreign</p>

all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to the second video we are going to talk about mitigation blocks so I hope everyone has done their homework I hope everyone has studied order blocks then the next thing for you to do after this video up until Tuesday 8 30 a.m when we talk about next topic study the mitigation block and the order block so study both things you might notice that you like one of them more than the other so you might like order blocks more you might like mitigation blocks more that'sperfectly fine you don't need to know everything in order to be profit find the thing you like and run away with it then as well this Sunday 8 30 am the 7th of May I'm going to be doing a live stream here on YouTube I'll have a reminder in my telegram link is in the description and we are going to be mainly going over mindset Etc because I feel like a lot of people have been struggling the past few weeks and that's exactly what I want to touch on alright now let's dive straight into it so for a mitigation block I havethese few structured steps right here the first one is pattern the second one is a low slash High the third one is overlapping now of course the steps won't make any sense if you don't watch the videos and that's the purpose of them so if we take a look at the first step the first step is pattern now the first thing I want you to acknowledge and this is very simple you don't need a lot of knowledge for you to understand this pattern the first pattern is basically we have a down move just a down movethen we have another up move this up move fails to take out this high this is a swing High swing High swing low will touch on it in a later topic this low this swing low fails to take out this swing high and then we see another rejection lower this is a swing failure again that's something we'll touch on in later videos as well so don't worry this pattern is called a swing failure pattern now what this swing filler pattern creates is a mitigation block so right here if we trade back into this lowthere is our mitigation block and then we continue lower now the third one is overlapping overlapping is indicating at this mitigation block there's another premium array in this case premium array because remember we're going lower we are looking at premium arrays there's another premium array overlapping with the mitigation block so that could be a fair value Gap here but that could also be what we learned in the first episode an order Block in this leg right before we take out the low there might be a little bearish orderblock right here overlapping with the mitigation block and that makes two premium Rays that's double as strong as one mitigation block alone so right here we have the pattern we have our swing failure pattern so write that down it's a swing failure pattern the next thing is the low in this case the low slash high if we turn this thing around we have the same exact thing we have the pattern right here we have the high and then we continue higher now you might say this is support and resistance well yes you're not wrong but the thing thatmakes it so strong is the logic behind find it and the thing why support and resistance sometimes works is because you'll see this exact pattern now the logic behind it is if if we are moving lower there will be buyers right here in this low and they will buy this leg up now once we move lower and we retrace back up to this low then the buyers the buyers in this leg have a chance to mitigate their buy orders AKA take a loss Etc or take a break even and then price is able to continue lower so for example let's say we are retailTraders and I don't mean retail as in the individual Trader I mean retails in the retail Concepts the support and resistance concept let's say we saw some nice support right here and we are buying this alright we're getting a rally perfect now we drop down immediately we're in drawdown now the next thing price retraces back to our entry we are able to mitigate that order and we can close it Earthly fine now there might be some traders that got in right here and then they take a little bit of a net lossperfect and that's what we need this liquidity for price to move now like I said in the previous episode we need for every buyer we need a seller for every seller we need a buyer now does that mean that Average Joe behind his monitor is getting taken out of the market because his five Lots is what the central banks and the institutions need no so if you ever see someone saying oh the market is hunting me well you're you're 100 Lots don't really matter we are talking about institutions that aretrading retail Concepts so the big big big boys not your neighbor that's putting 100 Lots on gold no that's not relevant and that's important to acknowledge because a lot of people think they are getting hunted by the market just because they placed an order this is not necessarily true now if you place an order on a b Book Broker open up the spreads they take you out and then it continues that's what happens a lot of the time on a b Book Broker so if you choose a broker I'm not here for youto use my affiliate link and go to my broker that's not what I'm doing here do your own research and make sure you're not trading on a b Book Broker not Financial advice as well first practice in demo and Brokers is something we can get into later on alright with this bit of the logic behind it Etc now of course make your own logic if this logic is not completely true perfectly fine if it works for you then it works for you and that's all that matters so if there's someone on Twitter that's telling you noyou don't have the right logic just tell them thank you for your opinion I'm going to do my own thing no need to get into an argument or anything we just focus on ourselves here all right now let's take a look at some live examples right here let me remove these things so the first one can you notice the first one right here it's the same exact pattern that we just had it's right here notice this down move the retracement up this low fails to take out this high then we have a swing failure the swingthis swing up pills to take out this High a swing failure we continue lower and then we have a slight retracement right here into what your mitigation block right here now let me remove the lines just to make it a bit more clearer and where do we take the mitigation block the low slash High we are bearish so we take the low of the mitigation block this can be the absolute low of the wick doesn't have to be the body so right here boom and again you can apply the same logic if you want to if that Wick isn'toverlapping with a fair value Gap then you take the body if the wick is overlapping with a further Gap then you take the wick that's up to you those minor differences that's a little personal preference just because you select the wick or the body is not going to make you a millionaire all of a sudden that's not what it's about and that's what a lot of people think right they they think oh is he is he selecting the body or is he selecting a wick just do what you prefer just because he selected the wick or the body that's notgoing to be a major Game Changer but again if you want to make it easy for yourself stick to the rule if the wick is overlapping with a profile Gap then take the wick if the wick isn't overlapping with a verify Gap then take the body alright but the last step right here is number three overlapping and again if you don't know what a fair value Gap is just yet perfectly fine because then later these videos will make even more sense when you re-watch them not if when you re-watch this video so the overlapping if you know what afavorite cup is what's overlapping with this mitigation block a fair value Gap and this is exactly what makes the mitigation block so strong and other PD arrays as well when there's something overlapping right here we have a fair value Gap and this is what makes it so so strong and this is as well for the advanced Traders when we notice this pattern price doesn't have to come all the way back up into here this is already fair value or price to continue lower and that's exactly when a mitigation block is sostrong and this is how I like to trade mitigation only when there's something overlapping preferably a fair value Gap alright so let's take a look at some more examples and some bullish examples as well so right here we have a bullish example and again if you do feel like it it's perfectly fine to pause the video and try to spot the mitigation block or any other block beforehand and before I touch on it this way you will learn faster alright so we have the pattern right here we have this big up moveright here we have this down move this I fails to take out this low and even this low continues higher which creates a mitigation block now it's very important for you to acknowledge and this is as well for you to write down it's a swing failure and write down as well it's not a breaker pattern now you might not know what a breaker pattern is just yet but it's a different sort of thing there's a swing failure and a breaker better write it down come back to it later on when we touch on Breaker blocks and then it willmake more sense so it's essential for us that we have this big move up first and then a high that fails to take out the low continue higher which creates the high a mitigation block now in this case if we do apply that rule let's then take the body instead again personal preference if you want to stick to that rule then perfectly fine stick to the rule the thing is on this High we take the up candle of the mitigation block so here we take the up candle just like we saw on the previous example when it's abearish mitigation block we take the down candle now what is overlapping see this right here there's an overlapping fair value Gap with that mitigation block and that's exactly what I like so much about mitigation block combined with a perfect Gap or as you'll see in another example combined with a border block as well alright so here we have another example now it gets interesting and again these things are not rocket science they are very simple structured easy steps trading is not a rocket science and it'snot supposed to be if we can keep it simple and there's a reason why we keep it simple and that's what I touch on a lot in the mentorship there's a specific reason why we keep things simple and why it's so so so important now if we take a look at this mitigation block right here we have the pattern the swing fill your pattern we have the high and we have something overlapping see what's overlapping it's an order block at the mitigation block and a verify Gap that's three discount arrays at the sameexact spot remember that because that's important the more overlapping PD arrays are at one spot the stronger the defense is so right here we take the up candle because it's a bullish mitigation block the mitigation Block in itself is overlapping with a fair value Gap and then just below that fair value Gap we have this order block as well remember what an order block is remember the steps of getting to an order block this is the exact steps and this is what makes a mitigation block so super strong all right now let's take a look at onemore example and then you're going to head into your own chart and do your own work as always remember if you don't do the work yourself then these videos will always just be some sort of entertainment for you watching videos without integrating the stuff and without working on it is just entertainment nothing more alright so right here we have another example and you can see how I'm using different time frames because this is a fractal thing every one of these topics is completely correct now the higher time frame thehigher the time frame we use the stronger the PD Ray so if we're looking at a weekly right now this will be stronger than a daily or a four hour video why the biggest orders are on the biggest time frames and if we know this effect then why not focus on the higher time frame and understanding the higher time frame because that's where the real orders are of Institutions etc etc so again the same exact pattern swing fill your pattern this High fills to take out this low we move higher after this high and this is what you'll see a lot rightafter we take the high and we close above it we have a fair value Gap right here overlapping with the high or an order block like we just saw and we move back into the mitigation block with the overlapping discount array we move higher now remember what I said this happens a lot when we close Above This High close not wicking the high and then we have a short-term return and then we push even higher so a lot of people say we have this mitigation block right here we have the swing filler pattern right here and now we're coming back all theway down would you still use the mitigation block no I personally wouldn't I would look at something on the higher time frame but from what I can see this mitigation block has already been used we've already traded back into it short term here this was our opportunity right now we just wait for new price action so we take the low slash the high in this case we take the high obviously overlapping or width of your value Gap and we push higher again swing for the pattern we close above it and that's a little golden nervous foryou if you made it to the end we close above it then we have a short term return another little Golden Nugget for you you're getting rewards for if you stay to the end of these videos and then we rarely hire close short-term return rally higher then we have the swing filler pattern the high in this case because it's a bullish mitigation block and it's overlapping with a verify gap or like we just saw on the previous example overlapping with an order block or another Discounter alright now for you I want you to study this on your ownI want you to make up your own logic of it I want to see if you can make up your own pattern of it so if you recognize a few things that happen over and over and over and over when these mitigation blocks hold but also look at a few mitigation blocks see if you can spot them that failed is obviously not every mitigation block will hold even if they are as clean as this one and that's the reality of trading all right I want to thank you quick reminder live stream on YouTube right here this Sunday 8 30 a.mNew York eastern time and we are going to talk about the mindset the Trader's mindset the champion mindset and the next video on the A to Z guide is obviously Tuesday 8 30 am New York eastern time as well alright thank you and make sure to do the work thank you thank you foreign

## <p>today I'm going to teach you a strategy that you can use and you don't need a daily bias all you need is a one hour time frame or whichever time frame you want to use you can get very creative with the time frames you need structure the structure that we already talked about but this Friday I will go again more in depth on structure just to reinforce the ID once you understand structure and you understand time the exact things we are going to talk about today you don't need much more this is going to be about indices but again this strategy itself can also be applied to Forex the main difference between indices and Forex is that indices have a very specific time frame where the volatility comes in during the day Forex of course also has kill zones but for any sys Equity is open is like it's Mayhem it's crazy so if you want to narrow down your focus to one specific moment on the day then the equities open might just be for you or which Forex doesn't have any still has a lot of volatility at the end of the day so at the PM session that is when Forex already dies down most of the time now I want to go over this strategy again disclaimer don't just blindly use this first go over all the episodes in the A2Z guide and make sure that you understand the basis of these strategies and in this case the basis is structure structure is your guide in this strategy ahead of time I will tell you I will tell you the exact steps that I'm using I'm using the one hour time frame on the one hour time frame I'm using intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows and in between that of course short-term highs short-term lows then I'm using time to my advantage I will exactly explain what I mean with that and then once we hit a one hour PD array I go into the one minute or the 5 min that is up to you both can be used because like I mentioned you can get very creative with the time frames if we take a look at es right here on the one hour time frame what are we seeing in last week's price action well right here on this Friday we have an intermediate term high sitting right there again intermediate term highs intermediate term lows Market structure in general next video is again where I will reinforce the ID of Mark structure but that is an intermediate term high that intermediate term high should hold ideally right if we are going lower the intermediate term High could not get violated with violated I mean it should not get disrespect so again that leads me back to the video that I had on Fair Value gaps are telling you a story then once we retrace right there we retrace into premium of that intermediate term range we come back into that for that Gap and then we slowly start displacing lower we have new fair value up slower then this strategy is mainly about equities open and PM session I personally don't like London session for indices if you are going to trade indices you might want to take a look at Ducks because that is one of the instances that is very volatile during London but es NASDAQ ym I would personally only look at them during New York sessions so what we notice here on this Monday we already displayed slower we display slower than on Tuesday London session we also displays lower then what do we see the obvious drone liquidity is what it's this low right it's that intermediate term load that is our first Target right in between this high right there and that low this area is where your short-term highs will start to hold that is where the St model will form and once that SD model forms that is exactly when the short-term highs will hold and they will hold until when until we reach that Target after we reach that Target what happens again we could see a bigger retracement so what is the next high that should hold it's the intermediate term height that got created right here that intermediate some high that is our context from this point right there this point until that point that is where we want to get involved after we take that Target we don't want to get involved anymore and we would want to wait we want to wait until we see something new at the right time so let me go over what I mean with that if that again let me Mark the Target right there that is our Target at the right time Equity is open 9 30 you can also start trading at 8 30. I have one specific rule for that if 8 30 the same as the Asia expansion what we talked about on the Forex strategies which is why every strategy I'm explaining is very important to understand and every video in the HD guide is very important because if 830 already comes into your PD rain already this place is lower or displaced away from the PD Ray then 930 will likely not take out whatever 830 already created the same with your London Killzone when Asia already expanded away from the PD array that's the same premise for the 830 and 930 rule so write that down I'll explain it one more time if a30 comes into the PD Ray and already displays away from the pity Ray so that's fair value gaps moving away from the PD array then 930 will likely not take out whatever a30 created this exact same with your Asia expansion so what do we notice on the one hour we have this rare value Gap right there that is exactly what we would want to see that is our fair value Gap close to the drama credit with you so do we expect a retracement all the way back to an overlapping PD Ray and then we continue lower not necessarily like we explained in the verify Gap videos and they're right there time will exactly tell us into which pdra it wants to sting into before continuing lore now what do I mean by that let me Define that with time I mean kill zones so that is your a30 as your 930 that is your London Kill Zone that is your New York am session your New York PM session when these skill zones start they will have a fake move but that fake move is not that relevant it's just a move into a premium array if we are continuing lower that Killzone will move into a premium array then it will show on the lower time frame and entry pattern when that entry pattern shows itself that is where you can get involved and you can Target the Drone liquidity why do I say time will tell you into which pdra you want to stick into and for from where it wants to continue lower because at that time is where the entry pattern will form it won't form earlier than that let me show you why if we now drop down into the one minute time frame here we are on the one minute time frame and what we can see is that this one hour for Value Gap is what we are working with so when we come into that one hour PD array at the right time so at a Kill Zone and then after that we have our entry pattern now I will explain two type of Entry patterns on a one minute what you want to see is if you're using one hour PD race you want to have a one minute fair value Gap lower then after that another one minute fair value Gap lower and once you have that second fair value Gap lower that is exactly when you want to get involved and what I mean with using the time frames very creative is if you go up in time frames and you use a five minute entry pattern then you only need one five minutes per Vega which you could enter off of so for example right here at 923 we sting into that one Upper Valley Gap did a30 already displays lower from a PD Ray no it did not so we're waiting for 9 30 to come into that PD Ray it does right there just ahead of 9 30 so there's nothing there yet then afterwards we have a sting again into the premium Ray at 9 30 and then we continue lower we have one further Gap the second fair value Gap sitting right there premium arrays already getting respected right there that is very important then this right there could already be your entry what do you cover you can cover that high why that high that is a short term high that should hold until we reach the target of this intermediate term low so that right there that is your Target that is a one to two in what in 10 minutes in not even 10 minutes that is is crazy there is one way of entering so if we follow the intermediate term highs right here the intermediate term highs again let me Mark them out again they are telling us that price wants to continue lower because structure is bearish right there so just based off of the one hour intermediate term highs we can see that structure is bearish so price is telling us it wants to go lower now a little Golden Nugget for you if you want to be even more accurate you can use daily PD Rays because the one hour is your guide towards daily PD race the price wants to reach into so right here what do we see again on this Thursday right there at the right time we come into that high we are sweeping high now this is when I tell you again time will tell you into which premium array it wants to stick into because beforehand could we have known that it wants to sweep those highs and then continue lower no we don't know but when that does happen when at the right time an equity is open right there it stinks into that high and sweeps it and then on a lower time frame we have an entry opportunity we react we don't sit still we react and we see all right it's sweeping we want to get involved right there because time exactly will validate the right premium array time will use the right primary and after it reaches into the primary then you will have your entry pattern so if we dive into the five minute right there so this is your five minute time frame and you can see that at 9 30 we push higher and this is your swing high right there we are sweeping and why are we sweeping it the fair value gaps are telling us a story again we have an immediate rejection lower where value gaps lower bullish for Vegas are not getting respected then we have one verify Gap sitting right there that could already be an entry opportunity but it doesn't sting into that alright perfect we have a new fair value Gap lower right there so we enter off of that and once we enter off of that further again we cover again the swing high right there that is your short term high with the same exact target the target being that intermediate term load that we had established on the one hour time frame because we're just following one hour structure so one hour structure is our guide then time will tell us into which premium array or discount array it wants to sting into then we use a one minute or a five minute entry pattern and remember the difference one minute two fair value gaps five minutes you only need one verify Gap now again I want you to either choose the one minute or the five minutes don't use both for your entry pattern either choose one minute or the five minutes now when can you actually go break even on this trade there is also something we will go more in depth on later on but you go break even also based on structure structure and displacements that will tell you exactly when to go break even using the short term highs right there now is this a trading strategy ready for you to use immediately yes it is it is for sure will you be successful with it from the first moment on no and don't put that pressure on yourself to be successful with a trading strategy from the get-go because that's very rare in the mentorship we always discuss a losing curve there's a mandatory losing curve you have to take losses first when you get used to a new trading strategy it's mandatory it always happens to every single one because you're getting used to a new trading strategy but the importance is you need to stick to it stick to the same exact strategy or a long period of time and see the results you will be mind blown doing the boring thing over and over the same strategy that is where your win rate will increase and your return will increase significantly but if you're using a new strategy every single week you will not see any results I can promise you that and again the reason why I'm sharing multiple trading strategies is of course we have different personalities so pick one you like I'm giving you inspiration here and then run with it and like I mentioned you can get very creative with the time frames because you can also use 50 minute structure and if you want to make it even higher probability you can also incorporate a higher time frame 3D race that way you can build onto the trading plan but don't overwhelm yourself because this core the core of this strategy is all you need you don't need some kind of weird New Concept this is all you need so please never never forget that then and on Friday again a very important Market structure video so be there and if you haven't watched the Forex strategies just yet I would highly advise to watch them as well it's the one right here on your screen and you can go to it alright perfect thank you [Music] thank you</p>

inspiration here and then run with it and like I mentioned you can get very creative with the time frames because you can also use 50 minute structure and if you want to make it even higher probability you can also incorporate a higher time frame 3D race that way you can build onto the trading plan but don't overwhelm yourself because this core the core of this strategy is all you need you don't need some kind of weird New Concept this is all you need so please never never forget that then and on Friday again a very important Market structure video so be there and if you haven't watched the Forex strategies just yet I would highly advise to watch them as well it's the one right here on your screen and you can go to it alright perfect thank you [Music] thank you

## <p>hello everyone hope you're doing all right and welcome to this first video well not actually the first but the first technical video on the A to Z guide so in the beginning this first video is on order blocks in the beginning you will have questions you will have doubts on certain topics etc etc this is completely normal write those questions done and they will likely get answered later on in the videos alright so I wanted to start with order blocks first off we are going over every PD array what is  premium and discount array premium obviously being if price is high it's in a premium and we are more likely to sell off and if we are in a discount for example here discount low prices we want to buy in discount we want to sell in premium so when I refer to a PD Array I refer to a premium and discount array if I'm looking for lower prices I'm looking to if I'm looking for lower prices I want to use a premium array and if I'm looking for higher prices I want to use a discount array alright so the first PD array I wanted to discuss is an orderblock now the theory behind order blocks obviously in the name order block there are orders inside that block whose orders are inside that block think of Institutions think of central banks institutions have such large orders they can't just simply press buy and sell wherever they want like weekend as retail institutions need to do the exact opposite of what price is currently doing to get into the mark so for example and by the way every up candle right here is white and every down candle is bluish black so institutions are buying Down Candles simply because their orders are so large they can't buy on up candles institutions Buy on Down Candles why for every buyer there needs to be a seller for every seller there needs to be a buyer if we know there are willing sellers right here who is buying those sell orders institutions what do we create when institutions are buying those sell orders order blocks alright so let's get into it how can we actually spot an order block again some things might be a little bit confusing because obviously it's the first video so go in with an open mind and don't expect to growth every single thing right now so we just explained the basics and the logic behind an order block of course if you have a different logic and that logic works for you please go ahead and use a logic my logic might not be for you and that's completely fine if you have a different logic and you want to use a different logic that's completely fine I'm not here to I'm not here to force a logic down your throat oranything My Philosophy Etc I said in the intro video everyone needs their own logic what makes sense to them everyone is a unique individual so everyone needs their own unique logic their own unique view on the market so again if my logic doesn't suit your logic stick to your own logic perfect be fine alright so if we know institutions are buying in Down Candles and selling in up candles then Up and Down Candles would be order blocks right correct so so let's go over a few criteria that an order block needsto have if we are looking for a bullish order block and note that down a bullish order block we want to see a down candle a down candle that fits the criteria area is a bullish order block a bullish order block needs to come off of support it needs to break the high of the down candle then that creates a bullish or block if it then returns to that order block we can possibly buy of course not Financial advice and then here you can see the fourth is empty empty stands for mean threshold mean threshold is 50 ofthe order block and it's only the bodies of the candle not the Wicks the bodies of the candle 50 of that is mean threshold so whenever I refer to mean threshold it's 50 of the bodies of a certain candle all right now let's look at some different order blocks for example these two Down Candles an order block doesn't have to be one single candle it can be but if there's multiple consecutive Down Candles or multiple consecutive up candle it is one big order block so these two consecutive Down Candlesare one order block is it coming off of a previous support yes we have a fair file you get right here now you might not know what a fair value Gap is currently so if you don't know write that down we'll get into it in a later video so these two Down Candles is one order block we are coming off of a previous support level this verify Gap if this is the if this is the order block what's the second thing we need we need the high to get broken what's the high of this or block since we can basically see this as a one big orderblock this is the high now the next thing we need is a return a return and a new push away this is the very basics of an order bug but the basics are important for you to master people like to skip the basics and this is why I said this A to Z guide is also for advanced Traders why Advanced Traders a lot of the times forget these simple steps and they are essentially ahead of themselves and they forgot to master the basics what makes someone a master is when they Master the simple Basics and they apply them on aconsistent basis master the basics and you will Master trading alright so we have one two three support level high gets broken we have a return perfect then the fourth one the empty the mean threshold the mean threshold would be this right here now this is a little bit Advanced now why is the mean threshold important and why did I even mention it if this order block does want to hold I wouldn't want to see the main threshold aka the 50 of this or block get disrespected disrespected meaning closing below the mean threshold now forthe open of the order block why did I take this Wick and not the body of the candle the wick is overlapping with a fair value Gap again you might not know what a favor Gap is right now so write that down so the top of the week only the top of the wick is important to me right here the top of the wick is overlapping or with a very very Gap right here and that's why I take the top of the wick if this wasn't overlapping with a verifying app then I would have taken the body of the candle why well if the wick wasn't overlapping with a fairvalue gap for example we can say let's pretend that this is the wick right here and it isn't overlapping with the flag at the top of the wick then the top of the wick is not the sensitive area the top of the wick is already mitigated so the unmitigated orders are right here in the body of the candle again remember what we've gone over a bullish order block is just Down Candles a bearish order block is just up candles but again the context behind them the steps etc those are important and that's why notevery down candle and not every up candle is an order block the context behind them is very important as well as are they aligned with your bias if you think price is going higher and if price is going higher then every up candle is not a bearish order block and if you think price is going lower so for example this up candle if price is in a bullish movement this is not a bearish order block now we've just gone over a bullish order block let's dive into some bearish border blocks as well so as you may haveseen right here try to spot all the bearish order blocks right here and what makes them a bearish order block alright so we are pushing lower after coming above this High AKA this week Above This high is a sweep of the high what is basically happening right here breakout Traders so people with a buy stop that are buying when the high gets broken right here will have a stop loss below this low so price will Target the opposite side now if we know this and we are sweeping this High then we have a bearish bias all the up candles that areforming when we have bearish buyers will act as an order block and these up candles will more than likely hold a lot of the times this right here is it coming off of a resistance again if we're looking at a bearish or block we want to see it come off of resistance and we're going to see the low get broken we're coming off of small fair value Gap right here we are rejecting away we are breaking the low and notice how mean threshold got respected right here no candle close above mean threshold then we have another up candle righthere this up candle is it coming off of resistance yes did it break the low off this up candle yes the low got broken right here did it return to the ore block yes it returned right here did you respect mean threshold yes it respected mean threshold very important for you to understand not every order block will hold not every order block where me threshold gets respected will hold not every order block where mean threshold gets disrespected will hold but we have to think in probabilities these are the highest probabilityconditions these are where the odds are in our favor and how do we select the bearish order box right here we take the bodies why no fair value Gap overlapping again if you don't know what a fair value Gap is write that question down and we'll get into it later now if we move on here we have this new order block right new up candle New Order block low gets broken a return to the order block the wick right here empty gets respected and we see a new rejection away now what do we create right here a newbearish order block is it as simple as this well yes it can be will it always be as simple as this no an order block will fill sometime now spotting a high probability order block and spotting a low probability order block if something we'll get into later for you it's important to now go over your own charts and seeing which order block holds and which order block fails by doing this you will train your own brain you will train your own eyes you will train your own intuition which is very importantbecause then you're developing your own Edge just by me telling you these steps will not help you you have to do the work on your own I'm just giving you the guidelines to get you to actually start the work now again this is an order block why it's coming off of previous resistance in the form of this order block the low got broken a return the return doesn't have to happen for it to be an Orbach only support and resistance and the high and low so the first two steps those two have to happen for it tobe considered an order block all right now let's take a look at some bullish order blocks as well alright perfect Can you spot the bullish order blocks right here so let's take a look together right here we have a bullish or block why we're coming off of some kind of support right here in the form of a rejection block write that down then the high is broken we see a return these are all consecutive Down Candles so this is one big order block mean threshold would be right here I mean threshold getsrespected what happens after we create a new or the block right here a new bullish order block why it's coming off of previous support in the form of this bullish order block then we create this new order block right here then we create a new order block right here and here we create a new order block this order block builds and we have a big rejection to the downside and then a continuation up now what does this create some form of New Order block right now what happened here this order block gets respected mean threshold getsdisrespected and we still continue higher we had this order block fail main threshold gets disrespected right here what is happening the market is wrong surely I'm doing something wrong right no not every order block will hold like I said not every time the main threshold will get disrespect and the order Buck will fail but we are working with probabilities and that's what a lot of people forget a lot of people forget that we aren't working with probabilities so after our loss after something doesn't work once or eventwice they will look for the next best thing something that will guarantee them 100 win rate and that's why a lot of people got into smart money Concepts and into ICT in the first place right A lot of people got into smart money Concepts into ICT why because they thought it was the answer to everything and in some way the market isn't random but if you are seeking for that just be very conscious of the fact that you might be searching for the Holy Grail because why a lot of people got into ICT and smart moneyConcepts in the first place is because they thought it was the Holy Grail and let me tell you it isn't and you will still take glasses and things will still fail alright let's continue right here I just want to touch on this last little order block right here this order block right here do we take the wick or the open of the order block there is a referral Gap right here but the top of the wick isn't overlapping with the forfeit so take the body study this price action that's coming up study this price actionon your own until Friday I want you to study and focus on order blocks so Wednesday and Thursday focus on order blocks order blocks order blocks order blocks which down candles are holding which up candles are holding why are they holding what's happening beforehand on which time frame are they dip me threshold get disrespected did it get respected what happened are we very high are we high in premium are we low in discount what is happening notice the patterns Etc use the journal that was provided in the intro videoand note all your discoveries if you truly master or blocked then I want to thank you and that's the end of the A to Z guide for you because order blocks alone could make you profitable on that note I'll see you in the next video on Friday and I want to thank you for being here alright thank you thank you </p>

## <p>hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video we are going to be touching on liquidity pools a very interesting topic and this is very important for you to understand because this is the basics of why our strategy works and how the market operates again just a little reminder if you have watched one ICT series and Romans for my master class are opening up tomorrow very limited spots so I mentioned in the beginning that the A to Z guide is for advanced Traders as well and if you don't think that the A2Zguide is for advanced Traders you are absolutely wrong and I don't mean that in a rude way but this A to Z guide is just as much for advanced Traders as it is for beginner Traders because if you watch these videos multiple times you will find certain golden nuggets that most likely only Advanced Traders will pick up on so if you're a beginner that's great watch the videos but maybe watch it a couple times and when you are further on your journey to becoming a profitable Trader maybe watch the videosagain and then you'll pick up on new things alright now let's get into it right here so liquidity pools what are liquidity pools well above highs what are above a highs above highs there are breakout trailers that are trying to buy price above ice breakout Traders so when price breaks out above a high they are trying to buy it with a buy stop but there are also stop losses of people that are short in the market both the stop losses and the breakout trailers use buy stops so above price above market price so for example Mark Priceis here above it are buy stops and below it are sell stops so if we we know that that makes up liquidity and now we need to find out how does the majority of the market trade the majority of the market the majority of Traders never gets past the simple patterns right they never get past the support and resistance the trend lines The Head and Shoulders patterns again there's nothing wrong with it because people are profitable with these patterns but I'm just trying to tell you majority of the people majority of the Traders trade like thatand they are most of the time referred to as retail Traders now a retail Trader we are also retail Traders obviously but retail Concepts or some people call them I don't like to call them that but they call them dumb money Concepts but again that's something we can touch on later on now if there needs to be a buyer for every seller and there needs to be a seller for every buyer who is actually providing that liquidity well if we know majority of the people have sell stops right here below Lowe's thencentral banks big institutions Etc their orders will get filled below these lows because their orders are so big they need some sort of liquidity to get into the market so for all the sell stops there will be buyers on the other side so right here once we do this and we come below a low below a consolidation or whatever I'll give you some real chart examples just in a few moments right here institutions central banks are buying those orders and obviously the sell-stop Traders right here the stop losses or the breakoutTraders are now trapped so now if we want to take profits on those buys because central banks institutions Etc they have just bought then who can we actually sell to well we need someone that is willing to buy our positions so we need liquidity again where is the liquidity above the highs we now need buy stops and above these highs is exactly where central bank's institutions are willing to take profit so they are willing to sell to buyers who is the buyer here well above a height you'll typically see breakoutTraders but also you'll see stop classes of people that were short in the market so both of those positions are buy stops so we are selling to buy stops so right here we are able to take profit not we the central banks and institutions are able to take profit now of course you need to understand central banks and institutions are not aiming for your liquidity they are not aiming for your two lots that you put into the market absolutely not they are aiming for huge funds for example you will hear the nameTurtle soups what is a turtle soup how was turtle soup invented do you recall and maybe Google it there is a book The Turtle Traders those Traders are called Turtle Traders and they mainly follow the trend so huge funds Etc they mainly follow Trends they are Trend followers when the trend changes they are hurting they are bleeding but when the trend continues Etc they are mainly correct in their analysis those huge funds that are turtle Traders so they follow a trend like this what does this make a liquidity sweep AKA a turtle soup thatis where the name turtle soup comes from so a turtle soup is a sweep of the turtle Traders alright now this is the basics the absolute Basics and the Necessities that you need to understand liquidity and to understand these liquidity pools because obviously we can trade this but we need some sort of logic behind it because also that will Comfort us when we have some sort of logic behind stuff our rational mind likes it more that's why a lot of people are here in the first place that's why a lot of people are trading SMC in thefirst place because we need some sort of logical explaining for everything and that is also detrimental let me tell you that is not always a good thing especially not in trading and again like I said right when you are placing a trade into the market so you are trading on your broker and and you're placing your two lots into the market you're buying with two lots you are not actually being targeted by by the central banks or buy the liquidity or Hunters we can call them no and we don't actually need a lot of oppositeliquidity to get out of the market as well or to buy or to sell because we are very small we are very very very small but again that's something we'll dive into deeper later on so let's dive into some real chart examples and how can we actually use this to our advantage alright so if we take a look right here what do we see well we see some sort of resistance right here right we have if we are now thinking as retail Traders or retail concept Trader so support and resistance and trend line Traders mainlythen right here we have resistance and we have some sort of support at the bottom right here so this should hold a support this support is now resistance right here so what is below this below this line there are cell stops those sell stops we or central banks and institutions can buy those sell stops right here they are getting bought where is now the opposite liquidity the opposite liquidity is above these highs buy stops so if we want to profit off of these buys right here well we will Target opposite liquidity we have bought we arewilling to sell above these highs we are willing to sell so we have a seller now we need a buyer who is willing to buy buy stops above debt resistance again that is people that were short here or even short right here when this turned into resistance with your stop loss right here above this resistance that stop loss is a buy stop and willing breakout Traders so then right here again what are we targeting even further well we have a relatively equal highs right here this is also resistance or support and resistance Traders so againtheir stop loss might be above it and we have breakout Traders above it there is liquidity above it then right here if we take a look at this we have some sort of trendline liquidity here right trendline liquidity and what do we have right here we have a high a above a high what's above a high there is liquidity so here above a high we are tricking in buy stops those buy stops who is willing to sell we are we are willing to sell or those buy stops and then now we are in a short position what do we need next if we areshort and we are going lower we want to because that's the mechanics how it works we want to buy at a lower price eventually alright so what is this this right here is support what is below it sell stops so we can pair ourselves with cell stops so we are able to take profit again this might be a little bit overwhelming so re-watch it a couple times and once you do dive into the charts on your own then this will make more sense and then you can see what are we now targeting this trendline liquidity there are willingbuyers at the trendline liquidity so we take that trendline liquidity out all the stop losses are right here beneath those lows that's where liquidity is and that's where we target all right now this is all all right now this is all fun but how can we actually apply this to our trading so let's take a look at how we can actually use this in our trading all right so if we take a look again at this example that we've used before on docs right here we had this monthly order block right here then ifwe drop down into the four hour we had this breaker right here what do we have here we have relatively equal lows they get the webs before we have the real move now when we retrace into the breaker what are we leaving behind we have relatively equal highs right here and we have relatively equal highs right here those can be used as Target or our traits and as extra confluences because in trading we are stacking up confluences all the time then if we drop down into the five minutes in that four hour breaker what do we actually seebefore we tap into the four hour breaker we take liquidity then the next thing we are doing we have right here we have equal highs we are taking them then right here what do what is above Price Right Here equal highs relatively equal highs where do we target right there relatively equal highs get taken now I want you to understand this is very important because this is a mistake I've made in the past as well just because there is equal highs just because there is trendline liquidity doesn't mean price has to go there immediately thatis the wrong mindset just because we have equal lows right here doesn't mean price has to now trade back into it so for example right here we had this liquidity right this is the consolidation eye right here we have a lot of consolidation that are willing breakout Traders above consolidations and below consolidations so price will very often take one side of the consolidation first and then Target the opposite side of the consolidation now if we take one side of the consolidation doesn't mean we can instantly Target the opposite side no weneed a reaction first we need some sort of sign that price is telling us yes we want to Target the opposite side and it is very important to understand that this is done on the higher time frame so if you're only trading liquidity pools on the lower time frame you will confuse the absolute out of yourself so right here we are taking the highs of the consolidation right breakout Traders are trapped stop losses are taken we are in a short position now if central banks and institutions are truly selling above those highs thenthey will not stay above those highs very long so we will see displacement to the downside and that is very important and the same goes or if we are taking liquidity so for example this low if we are taking liquidity below that low and institutions and central banks they are yes they want to get involved and obviously price will not stay below that low very long because their orders are so big so price will instantly move these orders these cell stops will instantly get bought boom just like that so we need to have some sort ofrejection right here we have a rejection and then we can Target the opposite side and that is very important to understand and a lot of people do not pay attention to that and they are just they think a highest getting taken and they are just shorting right here price is going higher and they are still short short and they are just taking loss after loss after loss after loss right here and another loss and price is just going higher it isn't even showing signs of weakness and it's just going higher andpeople are just taking losses after loss after loss after loss and that's not the right way to approach this we need to have a logic behind what we're doing and if institutions are truly selling above highs then price will not stay long above those highs and again you need to understand right I'm making sort of a story right here so I just told you that just because there's liquidity on the opposite side doesn't mean we are going to targeted immediately and then I just told you that if we are truly sellingabove highs and buying below loathe we need some sort of reaction they are in harmony with each other because when we get that reaction we can truly Target opposite side and then we can truly Target opposing liquidity as in we can truly Target this trendline liquidity now because we have seen a reaction away when we swept a low very important to understand always react always React to what price is doing alright now the last thing I want you to understand is a liquidity sweep is different than a liquidity run a run on liquidity is whenwe will continue lower so for example if we take a look right here above this High we just saw a sweep The Sweep is when we sweep liquidity right here above the highs and Target opposing liquidity now a run on liquidity is when we keep running so we don't sweep we just keep going lower so right here we have liquidity on the lows So Below the lows are liquidity we keep running we are not sweeping we are running the liquidity right there so it's going down and it's going to keep going down when we are running liquidityall right you are going to need to watch this video multiple times to understand it and you are going to need to absolutely do the work on your own as well so after this video study equal highs equal lows trendline liquidity study head and shoulder pattern so look up the patterns and see how price is absolutely being manipulated and see how we are moving from one liquidity pool to the next liquidity pool and in between those liquidity pools what do we see a breaker we see thumb form of PD erase that we went over we see them holdingright here until we take out the posing liquidity pool so again do the work and you will understand it a hundred percent completely no worries it just takes time again a reminder if you are a bit more advanced already than the enrollments or my mouse gloss are open right now so check that out if you are interested and I'll see you at the live stream on Sunday and if not then I'll see you on Tuesday at the next video on the A2Z guide alright thank you foreign foreign [Music]</p>

hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video we are going to be touching on liquidity pools a very interesting topic and this is very important for you to understand because this is the basics of why our strategy works and how the market operates again just a little reminder if you have watched one ICT series and Romans for my master class are opening up tomorrow very limited spots so I mentioned in the beginning that the A to Z guide is for advanced Traders as well and if you don't think that the A2Zguide is for advanced Traders you are absolutely wrong and I don't mean that in a rude way but this A to Z guide is just as much for advanced Traders as it is for beginner Traders because if you watch these videos multiple times you will find certain golden nuggets that most likely only Advanced Traders will pick up on so if you're a beginner that's great watch the videos but maybe watch it a couple times and when you are further on your journey to becoming a profitable Trader maybe watch the videosagain and then you'll pick up on new things alright now let's get into it right here so liquidity pools what are liquidity pools well above highs what are above a highs above highs there are breakout trailers that are trying to buy price above ice breakout Traders so when price breaks out above a high they are trying to buy it with a buy stop but there are also stop losses of people that are short in the market both the stop losses and the breakout trailers use buy stops so above price above market price so for example Mark Priceis here above it are buy stops and below it are sell stops so if we we know that that makes up liquidity and now we need to find out how does the majority of the market trade the majority of the market the majority of Traders never gets past the simple patterns right they never get past the support and resistance the trend lines The Head and Shoulders patterns again there's nothing wrong with it because people are profitable with these patterns but I'm just trying to tell you majority of the people majority of the Traders trade like thatand they are most of the time referred to as retail Traders now a retail Trader we are also retail Traders obviously but retail Concepts or some people call them I don't like to call them that but they call them dumb money Concepts but again that's something we can touch on later on now if there needs to be a buyer for every seller and there needs to be a seller for every buyer who is actually providing that liquidity well if we know majority of the people have sell stops right here below Lowe's thencentral banks big institutions Etc their orders will get filled below these lows because their orders are so big they need some sort of liquidity to get into the market so for all the sell stops there will be buyers on the other side so right here once we do this and we come below a low below a consolidation or whatever I'll give you some real chart examples just in a few moments right here institutions central banks are buying those orders and obviously the sell-stop Traders right here the stop losses or the breakoutTraders are now trapped so now if we want to take profits on those buys because central banks institutions Etc they have just bought then who can we actually sell to well we need someone that is willing to buy our positions so we need liquidity again where is the liquidity above the highs we now need buy stops and above these highs is exactly where central bank's institutions are willing to take profit so they are willing to sell to buyers who is the buyer here well above a height you'll typically see breakoutTraders but also you'll see stop classes of people that were short in the market so both of those positions are buy stops so we are selling to buy stops so right here we are able to take profit not we the central banks and institutions are able to take profit now of course you need to understand central banks and institutions are not aiming for your liquidity they are not aiming for your two lots that you put into the market absolutely not they are aiming for huge funds for example you will hear the nameTurtle soups what is a turtle soup how was turtle soup invented do you recall and maybe Google it there is a book The Turtle Traders those Traders are called Turtle Traders and they mainly follow the trend so huge funds Etc they mainly follow Trends they are Trend followers when the trend changes they are hurting they are bleeding but when the trend continues Etc they are mainly correct in their analysis those huge funds that are turtle Traders so they follow a trend like this what does this make a liquidity sweep AKA a turtle soup thatis where the name turtle soup comes from so a turtle soup is a sweep of the turtle Traders alright now this is the basics the absolute Basics and the Necessities that you need to understand liquidity and to understand these liquidity pools because obviously we can trade this but we need some sort of logic behind it because also that will Comfort us when we have some sort of logic behind stuff our rational mind likes it more that's why a lot of people are here in the first place that's why a lot of people are trading SMC in thefirst place because we need some sort of logical explaining for everything and that is also detrimental let me tell you that is not always a good thing especially not in trading and again like I said right when you are placing a trade into the market so you are trading on your broker and and you're placing your two lots into the market you're buying with two lots you are not actually being targeted by by the central banks or buy the liquidity or Hunters we can call them no and we don't actually need a lot of oppositeliquidity to get out of the market as well or to buy or to sell because we are very small we are very very very small but again that's something we'll dive into deeper later on so let's dive into some real chart examples and how can we actually use this to our advantage alright so if we take a look right here what do we see well we see some sort of resistance right here right we have if we are now thinking as retail Traders or retail concept Trader so support and resistance and trend line Traders mainlythen right here we have resistance and we have some sort of support at the bottom right here so this should hold a support this support is now resistance right here so what is below this below this line there are cell stops those sell stops we or central banks and institutions can buy those sell stops right here they are getting bought where is now the opposite liquidity the opposite liquidity is above these highs buy stops so if we want to profit off of these buys right here well we will Target opposite liquidity we have bought we arewilling to sell above these highs we are willing to sell so we have a seller now we need a buyer who is willing to buy buy stops above debt resistance again that is people that were short here or even short right here when this turned into resistance with your stop loss right here above this resistance that stop loss is a buy stop and willing breakout Traders so then right here again what are we targeting even further well we have a relatively equal highs right here this is also resistance or support and resistance Traders so againtheir stop loss might be above it and we have breakout Traders above it there is liquidity above it then right here if we take a look at this we have some sort of trendline liquidity here right trendline liquidity and what do we have right here we have a high a above a high what's above a high there is liquidity so here above a high we are tricking in buy stops those buy stops who is willing to sell we are we are willing to sell or those buy stops and then now we are in a short position what do we need next if we areshort and we are going lower we want to because that's the mechanics how it works we want to buy at a lower price eventually alright so what is this this right here is support what is below it sell stops so we can pair ourselves with cell stops so we are able to take profit again this might be a little bit overwhelming so re-watch it a couple times and once you do dive into the charts on your own then this will make more sense and then you can see what are we now targeting this trendline liquidity there are willingbuyers at the trendline liquidity so we take that trendline liquidity out all the stop losses are right here beneath those lows that's where liquidity is and that's where we target all right now this is all all right now this is all fun but how can we actually apply this to our trading so let's take a look at how we can actually use this in our trading all right so if we take a look again at this example that we've used before on docs right here we had this monthly order block right here then ifwe drop down into the four hour we had this breaker right here what do we have here we have relatively equal lows they get the webs before we have the real move now when we retrace into the breaker what are we leaving behind we have relatively equal highs right here and we have relatively equal highs right here those can be used as Target or our traits and as extra confluences because in trading we are stacking up confluences all the time then if we drop down into the five minutes in that four hour breaker what do we actually seebefore we tap into the four hour breaker we take liquidity then the next thing we are doing we have right here we have equal highs we are taking them then right here what do what is above Price Right Here equal highs relatively equal highs where do we target right there relatively equal highs get taken now I want you to understand this is very important because this is a mistake I've made in the past as well just because there is equal highs just because there is trendline liquidity doesn't mean price has to go there immediately thatis the wrong mindset just because we have equal lows right here doesn't mean price has to now trade back into it so for example right here we had this liquidity right this is the consolidation eye right here we have a lot of consolidation that are willing breakout Traders above consolidations and below consolidations so price will very often take one side of the consolidation first and then Target the opposite side of the consolidation now if we take one side of the consolidation doesn't mean we can instantly Target the opposite side no weneed

you're only trading liquidity pools on the lower time frame you will confuse the absolute out of yourself so right here we are taking the highs of the consolidation right breakout Traders are trapped stop losses are taken we are in a short position now if central banks and institutions are truly selling above those highs thenthey will not stay above those highs very long so we will see displacement to the downside and that is very important and the same goes or if we are taking liquidity so for example this low if we are taking liquidity below that low and institutions and central banks they are yes they want to get involved and obviously price will not stay below that low very long because their orders are so big so price will instantly move these orders these cell stops will

## <p>there is a method on how we can know which day will expand and on which day we should be taking trades that is when you use the economic calendar as your roadmap so using news drivers as your roadmap I will go over exactly how I use it and how I know which day of the week I want to get involved which they will likely be in consolidation and which day will likely have highest probability of expending higher or going lower so using the news or the economic calendar as your roadmap that is what very often gets set but again this is so vague what do you actually mean what does that mean let me give you the definition first and afterwards I'll explain it in depth using the economic calendar as your roadmap is when the economic calendar and price action itself are in agreement that is exactly when you want to be trading price action being in agreement with the economic calendar meaning if we are hovering above a discount array for example and on that day that we are hovering above a discount array and we have news so we have an economic calendar news driver or that particular day that is exactly when the economic calendar and news are in agreement that is when you want to be trading so let me explain that here we are on gold let me give you some context here on gold this is exactly what we went over as well in the free weekly forecasts we had this rare value Gap that daily for bag up to work with right there we were targeting all that liquidity but the main target was this daily for vehicle but I want you to focus on this fair value Gap right there now in the weekly forecast I mentioned that I would like to see this daily for vicab hold and push price higher and now you can see why I didn't expect a huge retracement to an overlapping PD array based on the previous episode where we talked touched on close to the Drone liquidity I would not want to see a huge retracement because that would be the exact opposite of what I would want to see if price wants to continue higher right there it will do it fast off of that fair value Gap how can we know on which day it wants to expand higher off of that Fairfax will it expand higher on any day on any particular day no it will expand on the day where we have a news driver supporting the ID of expanding higher so of course since we're trading gold what is a new driver that supports the ID of expanding higher you want to be focusing on the USD so the US dollar news drivers for gold now why do we actually use these new drivers what is a new driver what happens on a news driver news drivers bring in volatility in the market especially high impact ones they bring in a lot of volatility for that particular Market in order for us to trade in the first place what we need is volatility in the market is the whole reason why we use kill zones and that is the whole reason why we now are going to be using news drivers in order for us to trade in order for there to be an opportunity to trade we need volatility always if there's no volatility you will see price action like this consolidations rangy price action so I would argue that kill zones are very volatile for a certain session so kill zones when you want a lot of volatility for your scalping trades so maybe your one minute trades Etc focus on kill zones with close targets a short duration of time that is when you focus on kill zones mainly but if you want to focus and again this can also be beneficial for you as a scalper when you want to focus on will the day itself actually move and will the day expand you want to be focusing on the economic calendar if we have USD news USD Empire State Manufacturing Index for example then all the USD instruments that are related to the US dollar so that can also be your futures yes nasda attack ym gold silver EU gu all the major Forex pairs those are the ones that will be very volatile on that particular day now there's an exception to this Rule and you need to listen to this because it's very important and don't blame me if you mess up because if you are trading ahead or during the following three events that is fomc NFP and CPI you don't want to execute on that day ahead of the news event itself and you don't want to execute on the news event itself five minutes after the release whenever a setup presents itself that is perfectly fine only if it's after the news release itself otherwise you might get slipped and that is not trading that is gambling because think about it when you are trading CPI NFP and FMC and you're trading either just before it or the news event itself what happens you are at Major risk of getting your account slipped slippage is when your SL gets taken and you don't get filled at the right spot and you get filled way lower or way higher and Brokers are allowed to do this during these news events they don't get taken out at the right spot and you can get slipped like absolute crazy you can lose a lot of percentage you can even lose your whole account or even your funded account when that happens you are risking your whole account to make only three percent four percent so the risk to reward is not in your favor the odds are not in your favor because you need to have 100 win rate in order for you to then be profitable and no one ever has 100 win rate nobody so sooner or later you will mess up again I'm talking about CPI NFP fomc those are the ones you want to watch out for and only trade after the news release itself but for the rest of the high impact news events PMI BPI retail sales unemployment claims whatever it is it is perfectly fine to trade before the news release during the news release or after after the news release because these news events is when the day itself will already be more volatile the news is likely already priced in you don't think the banks the institutions don't already know what is going to happen news is just going to expand on what already was destined to happen it's all a smoke screen they can make the market very volatile and they have an excuse they have an alibi to move price so if we take a look again at gold right here this day this Friday came into that daily for Valley Gap now would you expect that Friday to already expand higher not really because obviously that is the opposite end of the week so based on the weekly profiles we would not expect Friday to continue a trend we would rather prefer a Thank God It's Friday setup like we talked about in the weekly profiles now on Monday Monday makes the low of this week right here staying into that daily for vice Gap why reason being because Monday are already had high impact US dollar news right here and you can see Tuesday is a huge expansion as well why US dollar news again so here you can see price action what was it doing we were hovering above a daily discount rate in the form of that fair value Gap right there on which day did we sting into it on Monday did Monday have the volatility yes there was volatility on Monday and Monday here make the low of the week yes it can because it has the volatility to do it and then Tuesday expends even higher so right there that is when you do want to trade a Monday so here ask yourself economic calendar and price action in agreement traded that is when you want to look for your trades a lot of people think day trading means every day trading no day trading means knowing exactly the days that you want to trade and when you want to get involved that is extremely crucial if you can know that you are ahead of 99 of the Traders you can already filter out the days where you know this is the highest probability and that is the day where we can actually explode higher or lower that is not done by our kill zones again that is done by the economic calendar knowing the economic calendar so here we are on EU and just to give you a little bit of context here on the daily we came into that fair value Gap right there that is what we had as a Target and we had a huge sting into it now we also have this fair value Gap to work with right there it's the exact same week the same economic calendar so we had news on Monday and on Tuesday for the US dollar now since it's EU Euro we also take a look at if Euro has some economic news drivers and that is an extra Confluence that we can use so if we dive into the 15 minute ride here we can see that this consolidation happens so I just told you Monday will likely be volatile yes but still price action action needs to be in agreement first right when economic calendar and price action is in agreement that is when we can move and we know which day wants to move so right here on Monday we come into that daily for fire gap and only once we come into that daily verify Gap that is exactly when we have the cleanest the highest probability moves on these days the days that I'm talking about where price action and the economic calendar are in agreement that is when you will have the absolute most beautiful price action for example if we now move on to Tuesday Tuesday right here did we have news yes we have news do we have price action in agreement yes because we reached that Target so we go into the 15 minute and look at what price action potentially wants to do and what happens we sting into it right there a very volatile day clean moves with a clear Target right there and what does it create it creates the high of the week the economic calendar is giving you a roadmap app exactly to how you can potentially know already ahead of the week even starting where the high of the week and where the low of the week will be and which days you want to be trading here we are on ES and I just wanted to show you an example of exactly what I mean on days that you want to avoid right there we are coming into a daily Vivica we were expecting higher prices off of this fair value Gap right there it is also a weekly fair value Gap and when we zoom in here on the 15 minute time frame we can see that we already came into it on Monday right there and Monday failed to push higher why Monday didn't have the economic calendar agreeing to the ID so believe me you can see it as the intention is there price wants to move higher there's no doubt price 100 wants to move higher the intention is there it just doesn't have the energy to do it there's no volatility to do it it needs energy AKA volatility to do it where's the energy for that week where's the volatility coming into the market for that particular week Tuesday Tuesday had the economic calendar on its side that is exactly when you can avoid this price action right there and that is exactly how we managed to avoid that price action now you can avoid getting stuck in price action like this where we don't actually expand higher and follow through and instead we can focus on days like this where we have a beautiful expansion and not only that you now can get to a pair and an instrument you can trade if you can look at the economic calendar and you see there's Canadian dollar news for example then where will the moves likely happen on Pairs and instruments that are closely related to the Canadian dollar so for example USD Canadian dollar or Canadian dollar JPY because you know that bear is the pair that wants to move this week and like we mentioned this is also a factor on how we can know if we will reach just for a fair value Gap or an overlapping PD array using the economic under so if you haven't watched that video just yet then here you can watch it perfect thank you [Music] foreign</p>

action what was it doing we were hovering above a daily discount rate in the form of that fair value Gap right there on which day did we sting into it on Monday did Monday have the volatility yes there was volatility on Monday and Monday here make the low of the week yes it can because it has the volatility to do it and then Tuesday expends even higher so right there that is when you do want to trade a Monday so here ask yourself economic calendar and price action in agreement traded that is when you want to look for your trades a lot of people think day trading means every day trading no day trading means knowing exactly the days that you want to trade and when you want to get involved that is extremely crucial if you can know that you are ahead of 99 of the Traders you can already filter out the days where you know this is the highest probability and that is the day where we can actually explode higher or lower that is not done by our kill zones again that is done by the economic calendar knowing the economic calendar so here we are on EU and just to give you a little bit of context here on the daily we came into that fair value Gap right there that is what we had as a Target and we had a huge sting into it now we also have this fair value Gap to work with right there it's the exact same week the same economic calendar so we had news on Monday and on Tuesday for the US dollar now since it's EU Euro we also take a look at if Euro has some economic news drivers and that is an extra Confluence that we can use so if we dive into the 15 minute ride here we can see that this consolidation happens so I just told you Monday will likely be volatile yes but still price action action needs to be in agreement first right when economic calendar and price action is in agreement that is when we can move and we know which day wants to move so right here on Monday we come into that daily for fire gap and only once we come into that daily verify Gap that is exactly when we have the cleanest the highest probability moves on these days the days that I'm talking about where price action and the economic calendar are in agreement that is when you will have the absolute most beautiful price action for example if we now move on to Tuesday Tuesday right here did we have news yes we have news do we have price action in agreement yes because we reached that Target so we go into the 15 minute and look at what price action potentially wants to do and what happens we sting into it right there a very volatile day clean moves with a clear Target right there and what does it create it creates the high of the week the economic calendar is giving you a roadmap app exactly to how you can potentially know already ahead of the week even starting where the high of the week and where the low of the week will be and which days you want to be trading here we are on ES and I just wanted to show you an example of exactly what I mean on days that you want to avoid right there we are coming into a daily Vivica we were expecting higher prices off of this fair value Gap right there it is also a weekly fair value Gap and when we zoom in here on the 15 minute time frame we can see that we already came into it on Monday right there and Monday failed to push higher why Monday didn't have the economic calendar agreeing to the ID so believe me you can see it as the intention is there price wants to move higher there's no doubt price 100 wants to move higher the intention is there it just doesn't have the energy to do it there's no volatility to do it it needs energy AKA volatility to do it where's the energy for that week where's the volatility coming into the market for that particular week Tuesday Tuesday had the economic calendar on its side that is exactly when you can avoid this price action right there and that is exactly how we managed to avoid that price action now you can avoid getting stuck in price action like this where we don't actually expand higher and follow through and instead we can focus on days like this where we have a beautiful expansion and not only that you now can get to a pair and an instrument you can trade if you can look at the economic calendar and you see there's Canadian dollar news for example then where will the moves likely happen on Pairs and instruments that are closely related to the Canadian dollar so for example USD Canadian dollar or Canadian dollar JPY because you know that bear is the pair that wants to move this week and like we mentioned this is also a factor on how we can know if we will reach just for a fair value Gap or an overlapping PD array using the economic under so if you haven't watched that video just yet then here you can watch it perfect thank you [Music] foreign

## <p>there is another vague Concept in the trading industry of course there's a lot but this one particularly I've never seen a clear answer to it and the vague concept I'm talking about is how far can price retrace before we continue or in other words where will price likely retrace towards before we expand again that is exactly what we are going to go over in this video again adding on to the previous episode is just as mechanical I will give you another entry opportunity another entry pattern you can potentially use because of course I am trying to get you to find your own entry pattern that fits your personality we have a lot of different personalities watching these videos exactly the reason as to why I'm showing you multiple entry patterns that you can potentially use find the one you like and stick to it run away with it and show me your results on Twitter wherever you want let's get into it so the first thing from the previous episode what was important again the context was important right the context is the most important part again what was the context in the previous episode it was moving from this video to PD array right here what are we doing on the higher time from on ES again we are going to go over innis's and Forex right here if I go to the Daily time frame we can see we are coming into that daily fair value Gap right there alright let's just take the daily for Vega if we zoom in on the one hour again we can see we had a nice rejection higher we have a few fair value gaps higher right there once we see this expansion higher alright we have a great idea the price might want to continue higher it might want to continue heading towards a premium array on The Daily time frame which was we first off have this fair value Gap right there and then afterwards we of course have this high right there as our ultimate draw on liquidity so let's stick to that high driving back into the one hour time frame we have this expansion but what can price now do what can it retrace towards first off what is the range that is causing that move higher that is causing this expansion higher it is what it is that range this swing low towards That Swing high right there that is AKA your dealing range right what we talked about in a previous episode and based on Market structure as well what is now your new engineer the term range it is this right there if you want more advanced insights then don't forget to visit my website oreo.io there's a link in the description as well sign up to that newsletter and that is exactly where I send more advanced insights so we have determined this is the range from this swing low to this swing High then if we draw a Fibonacci right there from That Swing Low to That Swing High hey we see a new Fibonacci setting we have something new to work with we have one and zero of course one is a swing low zero is at swing high that is your range then we have 0.79 0.7050.6180.5 and that makes up your optimal trade entry o t e 0.705 that is exactly your OTE level 0.5 is your equilibrium everything above it is in Pre premium everything below it is in discount I can already hear your brain crackling and making these songs because you're asking what is the relevance of this because we didn't even come into that OTE level exactly the point that is exactly the point I want you to use this OTE as a guideline but there's something else that is more important can you notice something else something that we have actually already touched on in the A2Z guide previously which is overlapping PD race so close to the 0.5 close to your equilibrium you will likely have overlapping PD Rays what is an overlapping PD Ray an overlapping PD Ray are just basically summed up two PD Rays at the same exact spot what do we see here we have a breaker right here overlapping with what a fair value Gap right there Deb makes up two discount arrays this fair value Gap alone is what it's first in premium of course and it is one discount array there's only one fair value Gap with nothing overlapping that overlapping discount array close to your equilibrium level doesn't have to be in discount doesn't have to be in discount remember that doesn't have to be at your OTE level because we will not always reach that OTE level the strongest magnet before we expand further is the overlapping pdra spot that is the strongest part so I'm going to exactly explain how you can use this in your trading plan right here we have this overlapping breaker with the overlapping fair value Gap right there we know already based on a one hour time frame and the context is the daily fair value Gap right there towards the daily highs right there alright we might want to continue higher so on a one hour time frame what can we retrace into before we continue higher the overlapping PD array right there close to equilibrium perfect right there and then we continue higher now will you enter on the one hour that is possible you can enter on the one hour right there that is already in entry but I know of course some people don't like one hour entries so this is all fractal because now we can dive into the one minute right in this area and look for another entry but first off before I dive into the one minute what do we need well before we look for an entry before we see how far a one minute time frame can retrace Etc don't we need some kind of contact what is the context here on the one hour discount array right there towards what first premium array right there ultimately this premium array right there that is your account if you're entering on a one minute don't think you can Target the daily highs it all is relative it's all in perspective if you are entering on the one minute you wouldn't have weekly Target that's not logical the time frames are not in alignment with each other right there right now they are in alignment with each other one minute entries One Minute Target that is important to understand so right here we go into the one minute time frame all right perfect so here we are on the one minute time frame now this is your one hour breaker your one hour overlapping PD race then here we had the first Target and here we had the second target now let's look how we can use the overlapping video race concept and the OTE concept to get to an entry first off I'm not going to dive into how we can potentially see the market shift that is an episode that is coming your way in the ATC guide don't worry I just need you to understand that we are moving higher here and that we have a breaker right there so this right there is what it's a breaker with that breaker we have something overlapping right we have this overlapping fair value Gap now that right there is already your first entry let me tell you I love fair value gaps where price will retrace towards and how far price will retrace the answer lies in overlapping pillars and in Fair Value gaps you first off need a fair value Gap and in every example you will see what I'm showing you here there's a fair value Gap there's a certain fair value Gap right there whether it's on the same time frame or a time frame above it there is a fair value Gap right there fair value gaps tell you a story for Vega will tell you where price will likely draw towards and fair value gaps tell you how far price will retrace because if there's a verified Gap right there and it's overlapping with a breaker the rule on your entry time frame right there is enter on the first place where we have overlapping period an overlapping PD Ray is a fair value Gap overlapping with another discount array in this case of course if we are looking for short we would look at a premium array where is the first place where we have a fair value Gap overlapping with another discount rate this breaker and this verify Gap now if you want to refine it and of course be my guest you can use the OTE right here and you can draw it like that enter on the order block right there close to equilibrium overlapping with the fair value Gap something along the lines of that right perfectly fine if you want to refine it like that perfectly fine but the thing is you need a set entry pattern that you can stick to and the reason why this is important because otherwise you would one time enter on the breaker right there one time enter on equilibrium right there that is exactly why I'm giving you the rule enter on the first overlapping PD Ray the first overlapping PD Ray right there for your entry pattern is this breaker with that for Vega because then you have no excuse to then sometimes use OTE sometimes use the order block sometimes use this no first overlapping discount array in this case so boom there is your entry now what would you cover SL placements stop loss placements is also something we are going to go into in more detail one step at a time but what you're going to cover here is the intermediate term low which is right there perfect you don't get stopped out right there and we continue higher right there with the first Target being this High second Arc being that high right there now let's say we wanted to wait a little bit longer again and we saw this expansion higher again expansion why is it an expansion this fair value Gap higher in order for us to enter the first question we always ask or subconsciously ask is alright if I want to enter how far will it actually retrace that is a question you ask yourself right so what will it retrace into REO set the first overlapping PD Ray mitigation block with an overlapping what fair value Gap right there so you enter off of that fair value Gap right there now you notice how I am entering on the fair value gaps because I I love perfect and that is exactly what makes it mechanical what could also make it mechanical is you enter on the exact spot where we are overlapping with the PD Rays so for example that will make the entry a little bit lower right there that would make this entry a little bit higher right there with the same stop loss placement of course stop loss placement right here beneath that intermediate term low right there Target firstly that Target second target right there and we continue higher continue higher and right here what happens what happens let's see if you paid attention to the market structure video what happened here this lag bills but why because this is just a perfect entry right overlapping for Value Gap overlapping order block but what happens remember the structure video remember what do we see boom we take out an intermediate term high so what is expected a bigger retracement so what do we see we draw the Fibonacci on the intermediate terminal towards the new intermediate term High towards the new Target right there what is close to equilibrium this order block with what a 15 minute pair value Gap and the reason I zoom out there is because if you remember if we retrace after taking the intermediate term high or any intermediate term low we usually retrace to something on on the time frame above it so the one minute needs to be in context of the time frames above it in other words you are forming your context again you need to form that new context again because if we look this from a very mechanical perspective like we touched on in the previous episode as well we moved from this one hour discount rate to that one hour premium array that is on the lower time frame an intermediate term high right there we get a bigger retracement right there we know that if we have a bigger retracement and these lacks fill it is because after taking an intermediate term High We retrace into what we retrace into something on the time frame above it and what did we talk about in the previous episode we hold in the area of context price is the highest probability in the area of context what is the area of context it is this from the discount to the premium rate this part right there on the right side right here that is where you want to get involved after we take out that height that first Target you want to wait for new contacts what is your new context equilibrium 15 minute per Vega targeting again that same one hour high can you see how I'm doing the same exact thing as that we did on the one hour that context first and then we have a reason to go into the lower time frame a lot of people don't understand a lot of people they go into the one minute time frame without having any boundary there's no boundary there needs to be a boundary to go into the one minute time frame if you are going into the one minute time frame without having a boundary you will always have a reason to trade if there's always a reason to trade then that's not high probability is it because there's always a reason to trade everyone can make up a reason in the market to get in everyone can justify a trade ID everyone but very little people know when to look at a trade ID and when to get involved that is the difference that is what differentiates amateurs from professional so afterwards we reach that on the one minute we continue higher right here then what happens again what do we see we see this fair value Gap reaching only into that perfect why there's a breaker right there afterwards again same story what do we retrace into this overlapping with what this old high as well that mitigation block now because remember this whole move is now a swing failure and a fair value Gap right there or block this is actually three discount arrays because here you have a fair value gap an order block and a mitigation block right there that is perfect all right let's give you one more example all right here we are on GBP Australian dollar now the first thing I want you to understand is that we will not always retrace back into an overlapping Fairfax with an overlapping PD array there are certain conditions when this doesn't happen these conditions is exactly what we will also go over in a later episode don't worry right here first off what do we need again context we need context what is the context here overlapping discount arrays two overlapping discount race preferably minimum two overlapping PD race we have one very Gap sitting right there then we also have one small little breaker right there perfect I like that now if we retrace back into that right there now we have a boundary we have a reason to go into the lower time frame what is the first Target first Target is that what is the second target second target is and the ultimate Target is right there if we head into the five minute right here here we see an expansion but not a large retracement and then we expand higher again alright no worries because if we now look at the overlapping discount race again what is the first overlapping discount array that we encounter the first overlapping discount array is what it is this order block right there with that rare value Gap right there exactly there is our entry now I can hear you think where would you put your stop loss would you put your stop loss right here no you wouldn't you absolutely wouldn't that is not a great stop-loss placement and let me explain why again we are working with probabilities here I am doing something that's Based on data I am doing something that works based on probabilities again that is why the belief the market is not random that belief is very dangerous so I know there is a small chance right there that price might do something like this because they're still for if I get right there and this is intermediate term low ride so we shouldn't take that out now I know of course like we've talked about in a market structure video as well if we haven't taken out that intermediate term High aka the Target right there and obviously the short term ranges right here will likely hold until we take that out but that is based again on probability nothing works 100 of the time in the market so right here this could very well all do something like this and then continue higher and if you've done so much work you have done so much work based on finding the context based on waiting being patient and then you absolutely mess yourself up on the entry and you miss the boat you found your entry pattern the context is there everything is there but you mess yourself up and you don't reward yourself that is the worst thing you can do so rather than being greedy and finding the best RR and flexing on Instagram and flexing on Twitter why not giving your stop-loss some room to breathe putting it at the breaker or even putting it at the intermediate term low right there covering the bodies of the candles right there that is perfectly fine then you have a one to two right there and you have a one two five right there that is absolutely beautiful I would rather actually make money and be a part of the move than constantly getting stopped out because I want the best RR and I want to flex on no just catch the move reward yourself reward yourself on the hard work that you've done so right here there we get tapped in right there [Music] foreign ly your take profit gets hit and

yourself that is the worst thing you can do so rather than being greedy and finding the best RR and flexing on Instagram and flexing on Twitter why not giving your stop-loss some room to breathe putting it at the breaker or even putting it at the intermediate term low right there covering the bodies of the candles right there that is perfectly fine then you have a one to two right there and you have a one two five right there that is absolutely beautiful I would rather actually make money and be a part of the move than constantly getting stopped out because I want the best RR and I want to flex on no just catch the move reward yourself reward yourself on the hard work that you've done so right here there we get tapped in right there [Music] foreign ly your take profit gets hit and that is absolutely beautiful so again remember if you want more insights more detailed insights mario.io sign up right there and please remember every Sunday 8 30 we have a live stream feel free to join we have a big Community right there huge Community full of positive like-minded people so feel free to join and feel free to chat feel free to ask questions and I'll see you at the next one

## <p>hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video on the A2Z guide today we are going to talk about reclaimed order blocks the name in itself already says a lot but we are going to dive a little bit deeper into it now as well this will touch on the very basics of a market maker model and an advanced Market maker model video will come later in the A to Z guide as well a little announcement might mentorship enrollments for the master class is opening up again this Saturday so that's the 20th of May and they willclose again at the end of next Monday so that is the 22nd of May so in that time period I open up the enrollments so if you are interested and you're a little bit more advanced in ICT so you've watched one series minimum and you feel overwhelmed with all the information then this might be for you link is in the description if you do want more information on it so do check that out if you are interested alright without further Ado let's dive straight into it so here in the top right you can see thefirst step is understanding that there's two curves so there's two curves of the marker right we have a cell curve right here and then once we reach a certain discount array we have a by curve right here and we're going higher and higher this is the basis of a market maker model so take notes if you don't know fully Watermark maker model is and again we'll touch on everything in this A to Z guide so this is two curves we have a cell curve and a by curve now this is a marker maker bi-model and then theopposite would be a buy Curve and then another cell curve this is a marker maker cell model now why is this important well these marker maker models happen everywhere the context behind them is very important again there will be a more advanced marker maker model video so don't worry but we need to understand that if we are looking for higher prices so we are expecting a market maker by model then right here when we are moving down institutions their orders are so huge that those institutions they can't just simply buy and sell likewe can like retail can now they have to get in the market earlier so if we have a market maker buy model and we are anticipating a market maker by model 2 form then on the sell side of the curve that is already where institutions are buying so what you'll see is you'll see order blocks start to form bullish order blocks remember a bullish order Block it's a down candle and the high of the down candle gets broken they get formed on the sell side of the market maker by model so right here Order blocks are forming becauseinstitutions are already buying they are hedging they are already in the market they are offering counterparty liquidity to all the sellers right there and then once we reach a discount array so that's very important for you to acknowledge that's very important for you to write down as well once we reach a higher time frame this country or some sort of discount array then you will likely see some sort of displacement with maybe a market structure shift and then we might see a shift in order flow and then all the order blocks thebullish order blocks that's formed on the sell side of the curve of the marker maker bimodel Curve will hold us support and then we push higher that's the basics of a market maker model so remember we have a cell side curve and a bisect curve cell curve by curve that's it and inside the cell curve there will already be order blocks and once we trade above them on the right side then they are called reclaimed order blocks so what does that look like on the marker maker cell model exact same thing just inverse right herewe have the buy Curve these are ready so right here inside here there could be a bearish or block that gets traded through first and then holds us a resistance right here because now it's a reclaimed or block once we are on the right side so we have the left side the by side of the curve on the market Mega cell model and then we have the right side the cell side of the curve on the marker maker cell model and these right here will be your reclaimed order blocks all right now we have discussed the two curves so the twocurves then we have order block or block what is an orb block again order block a bullish order block again a down candle where the high gets broken remember that step that we talked about in the first video you only need to know that step that the high gets broken on a bullish order block on the bearish order block the low gets broken right so that is a bearish or block again we've also talked about the steps for in that steps on the order blocks but that's not really important we just need to know a bullishorder block the high gets broken on a down candle and a bearish or block the low gets broken of an up candle and that's it that's what we need to know so then the third step is left so you always look to the left to spot your reclaimed or blocks because we have two curves and on the left side so that first curve whatever that is this that's where the reclaimed order blocks will be alright now let's dive into some real chart examples so right here we have the four hour order block remember an order block this is a four hour orderblock and then if we drop into the lower time frame and we drop into the 15 minute right here we have a buy side of the curve and a cell side of the curve the very basics of a markup maker cell model so two curves buy side sell side right here if we take a look at some order blocks some bearish order blocks that were formed on the by side of the Curve so for example we have one right here take the body of the order block right here and then if we zoom in a little bit we have another one right here then we have another big one right herethen we have another one right here can you see how many reclaimed order blocks there are in this little section right here see what price it did right here it had a very difficult time getting Above This level again once we move down below every reclaimed order block right here it was very tough for price to get above these reclaimed order box right here again so here you see consolidation and we touch again higher but we never come back above those reclaimed order blocks and if we take a little bit of a looklower right here what do we have a bearish order block and here right here we have another one now you might notice I'm not taking the consecutive up candles here I'm only taking the last up candle right here so that's a little difference in the ore block as well that's just for me because we're taking things from the left right here it's a little bit more Precision but that way your chart doesn't get clustered as well of course as you can see already I don't like how there's somany lines already here so what is a solution to that well you might notice the reclaimed order blocks that work well are the ones that are overlapping with something else I always emphasize on this fact PD arrays are great they are absolutely awesome but and especially reclaimed order blocks I only like to use them when they are overlapping with another PD array so instead of having a thousand lines on your chart right here what I would have is I would have this right here why let me explain we have this reclaimed or blocks and again reclaimedorder blocks are not that exciting right they are very easy to spot Etc when is it actually becoming a reclaimed order block when we are trading below it so when we are trading below it whether it's a wick or body once we are trading below it then it becomes a reclaimed order block so right here we are already trading below it we can see we have a move higher what is happening here we don't have any clear overlapping PD array we don't even have a fair value Gap as overlapping there and pay attention to what happened is next righthere what do we have here we have an order block we have a verifier Gap here we have mitigation block there is four things overlapping here come with me one reclaimed order block mitigation block order block fair value Gap four things overlapping that's what makes BD arrays so strong so always look where is a logical place we can return to that isn't all the way up here so all the way up here isn't really relevant but that's close to current price action that we can return to where the most overlapping PD rays are alright so if wetake a look at this other one right here we have an up candle we are trading below that up candle so we're breaking low this could be a bearish or block ride we disrespected fully we then have we are finishing the buy side of the curve cell side of the curve we are trading back below this old bearish or block this now becomes a reclaimed order block then right here what is overlapping with this reclaimed or block well there's a mitigation block again in close proximity to it there's an order blocksitting right here and you have a verify Gap here and here so a sting into this River Gap wouldn't have been crazy right we could have seen it coming because we have a lot of things overlapping for us and that overlapping part that's what I want you to understand for this reclaimed or block because otherwise like we just had in the beginning your charts will be clustered with reclaimed or black hair reclaimed auto block here reclaimed order block here right here right here and we have a thousand lines and that's not accuracyright we can tell you all right price will bounce off of one of these thousand lines yeah well no right and that's the same part as if we draw random lines right here complete random lines right look at this resistance resistance right here it's resisting it all right now it's acting a little bit of support all right resistance again and if we go even further to the left look at this perfect support Perfect Resistance right here Perfect Resistance perfect right just randomize resistance becoming support it's consolidating arounddeadline because its support and resistance look to the tick to the absolute tick right perfect accuracy if you have a thousand PD arrays on your chart then you are not accurate No you're just guessing and that's why I don't like to explain a thousand PD arrays because it's not accuracy anymore it's just random and what a lot of people like to do on Twitter and Instagram Etc or even on YouTube they say look at the accuracy well no you have a thousand PD arrays on your chart it will respect one of them what is theaccuracy there there is no accuracy so understanding those overlapping PD Rays that's so important because the PD arrays in itself are not that hard to spot right but knowing where it will likely bounce off of where it will reject that is pretty hard to spot the way we can spot that is by focusing on the most overlapping PD race and again we will dive into this deeper and deeper don't worry this is just the basics alright now let me give you a bullish example as well alright we didn't have to go very far this right here is oursell side of the curve right this is our buy side of the curve so we have again two curves then on the cell side of the curve where are the order blocks so the cell side of the curve focus on the bullish order blocks because we are anticipating a higher prices alright well if we take a look right here and dive a little bit deeper into price action we have this would be considered a bullish price action right again the body of the down candle right here the high gets broken the very basics of an order block andeven an order block right here and even an order block right here and even right here again we have a thousand lines on our chart and we can make the same argument again whoa look at the accuracy well they're not really accuracy because we have a thousand lines obviously it will bounce off of One how can we make this more accurate well this reclaimed order block and we could even say this is a reclaimed World block as well right because the high of this down candle gets broken with an up candle right herewe drop down below we are still on the sell side curve and then we initiate the bicep curve what happens right here we have an overlapping fair value Gap we even have some sort of breaker overlapping so that's three discount arrays reclaimed order Block Breaker fair value Gap where does it go higher off of is very very Gap overlapping with the other two discount race and that's exactly what I'm trying to tell you here and that's exactly what makes BD arrays so strong when they are overlapping withanother PD array and again this reclaimed order block as well right what do we have overlapping well we have this big order block right here coming off of this fair value Gap pushing higher new displacement fair value Gap this small order block there's a lot of stuff overlapping and that's what makes it interesting so what I want you to do I want you to study this reclaimed order block but I want you to study how many blocks so all the blocks we went over how many can you find that are overlapping so find find thesimilarities of reclaimed order blocks that are holding and find out why are they holding are they overlapping with a lot of other PD arrays because very often that's the case so study those two curves those order blocks on the left side once they get traded above or below they become reclaimed are they overlapping with something and that's where the highest probability reclaimed order blocks are and other PD Rays alright last reminder masterclass enrollments of my mentorship are currently open that have been greatresults of the most clots so far so if you have watched one ICT series at least and you have pretty good knowledge on ICT so far then that might be for you again very limited spots and very limited time only that weekend from the 20th of May until the 22nd of May for you to sign up and then enrollments will close again alright I'll see you at the next video on Friday thank you thank you [Music]</p>

## <p>a full trading plan using a London Kill Zone that is exactly what we're going to talk about today we are going to talk about two scenarios because there's two variables to it first we have an Asia expansion and we have an Asia consolidation both Rivals is exactly what we're going to go over we're going to start off with the Asia expansion so let me guide you through this price action right here on EU on the free weekly forecast actually we mentioned this fair value Gap right there on EU we came into it right there then if we drop down into the four hour on Wednesday we had a bearish fair value Gap right there and we had this order block sitting right there now what you might notice this is the exact same setup is that we mentioned in the turtle soup video the only thing different is the entry pattern the only thing you are doing on the lower time frame is you you are getting in sync with price on the higher time frame that's all you're doing the hard work is done on the higher time frame so if we move from that premium array on the four hour dead or the block what is our Target our Target is this swing low on the four hour that is your discount rate premium rate to Discount array so we dive into the five minutes and here we can see that Asia right there is already in the premium array and Asia already expands lower whenever this happens that is perfectly fine on your entry time frame right there if Asia already has bearish fair value caps that is perfectly fine so Asia right there is a bearish Vegas right there very sure if I get right there going low as well and London opens up right there right there all I need to see in London is a new bearish fair value Gap then I enter on the overlapping PD array right there where is my bearish survival Gap in London right there where's the overlap in PD Ray it is right there that right there is my entry this is actually very similar to my own trading plan where would the stop loss go well would stop loss go above that high no it would not why not well you have to take into account the time frames above it like we always mentioned the time frame you are trading on needs to be in context of the time frame above it five minute needs to be in concert with the 50 minute is there something on the 15 minute Affair value gap or whatever hovering above that high there's a 15 minute fair value Gap sitting right there and it's a one hour fair value Gap as well so does price have a reason to come back there yes it has so what would you do in that case you cover these highs price has no reason to come back there which on the 5 minutes is this intermediate term high right there now what was your target again it was that four hour low so that right there is your your target a super nice little trade on a Thursday a 1-3 perfect and afterwards you even have another entry because you have that re-entry right there that is another entry and now you can cover this new intermediate term high that is in the making right there targeting the same exact low right there which is an intermediate term low on the 5 minute time frame which was just that simple for our Target you might think Hmm this is too simple this is too easy can it be this simple yes it can this is all you need this is your AMD your power 3 your midnight open your new week opening Gap your Enigma everything that you need is involved in just this simple trading plan the only thing is you are not paying attention to it and you don't need to so this is the variation of the Asia expansion now let's go over the classic London setup just to give you some context it's important to understand right here that on gu we hadn't reached that high just yet which was our draw on liquidity so if we go into the four hour right there and we look at this for our fair value Gap that right there is a short opportunity until we reach that drone liquidity with the first Target being that low and then the second target of course being that drone liquidity this is actually a trade that a few members inside the money making team inside the Discord actually caught so if we now go into the five minute time frame right there London starts right here again what do we need in London we need bearish fair value gaps being created in London itself when we come into that premium array again right there we have the first bearish River Gap and you wait for a second bearish fair value Gap so you have a first bear Gap and you wait for a second one we trade into the first one and then we have a second bearish fair value Gap that is again your SD model then that right there that is your entry governing the intermediate term High targeting what targeting the exact same Target that for our swing low that is already a one to four that is perfect and this is where Asia is in consolidation but again Asia being consolidation or an expansion is not even relevant it of course it's somewhat relevant but this being a consolidation or an expansion is not a big deal we have mechanical guidelines to getting involved right there this is your London strategy again your midnight open your power 3 your AMD your Macros every fancy concept you need your Reaper whatever you want to call it everything is involved here but you're not paying attention to it and that is the beauty you can do the exact same with daily PD race only daily PD race you would not use the five minute entry time frame you would go up in time frames that is very important to understand now this trading plan particularly the London trading plan I would advise to focus on Forex pairs you can trade it for innocence but I will have a different trading strategy for indices as well and if you're a New York Trader then I will also have a New York strategy so follow along with the ATZ guide and those videos will come no worries now if you're interested in more of this and the exact mechanics behind it then the mentorship might be something for you link is in the description or visit oreo.io and if you're not sure on how I developed this trading plan then I would highly advise you to check out this video which is another video in the A2Z guide which will tell you everything you need to know alright perfect thank you thank you thank you</p>

it five minute needs to be in concert with the 50 minute is there something on the 15 minute Affair value gap or whatever hovering above that high there's a 15 minute fair value Gap sitting right there and it's a one hour fair value Gap as well so does price have a reason to come back there yes it has so what would you do in that case you cover these highs price has no reason to come back there which on the 5 minutes is this intermediate term high right there now what was your target again it was that four hour low so that right there is your your target a super nice little trade on a Thursday a 1-3 perfect and afterwards you even have another entry because you have that re-entry right there that is another entry and now you can cover this new intermediate term high that is in the making right there targeting the same exact low right there which is an intermediate term low on the 5 minute time frame which was just that simple for our Target you might think Hmm this is too simple this is too easy can it be this simple yes it can this is all you need this is your AMD your power 3 your midnight open your new week opening Gap your Enigma everything that you need is involved in just this simple trading plan the only thing is you are not paying attention to it and you don't need to so this is the variation of the Asia expansion now let's go over the classic London setup just to give you some context it's important to understand right here that on gu we hadn't reached that high just yet which was our draw on liquidity so if we go into the four hour right there and we look at this for our fair value Gap that right there is a short opportunity until we reach that drone liquidity with the first Target being that low and then the second target of course being that drone liquidity this is actually a trade that a few members inside the money making team inside the Discord actually caught so if we now go into the five minute time frame right there London starts right here again what do we need in London we need bearish fair value gaps being created in London itself when we come into that premium array again right there we have the first bearish River Gap and you wait for a second bearish fair value Gap so you have a first bear Gap and you wait for a second one we trade into the first one and then we have a second bearish fair value Gap that is again your SD model then that right there that is your entry governing the intermediate term High targeting what targeting the exact same Target that for our swing low that is already a one to four that is perfect and this is where Asia is in consolidation but again Asia being consolidation or an expansion is not even relevant it of course it's somewhat relevant but this being a consolidation or an expansion is not a big deal we have mechanical guidelines to getting involved right there this is your London strategy again your midnight open your power 3 your AMD your Macros every fancy concept you need your Reaper whatever you want to call it everything is involved here but you're not paying attention to it and that is the beauty you can do the exact same with daily PD race only daily PD race you would not use the five minute entry time frame you would go up in time frames that is very important to understand now this trading plan particularly the London trading plan I would advise to focus on Forex pairs you can trade it for innocence but I will have a different trading strategy for indices as well and if you're a New York Trader then I will also have a New York strategy so follow along with the ATZ guide and those videos will come no worries now if you're interested in more of this and the exact mechanics behind it then the mentorship might be something for you link is in the description or visit oreo.io and if you're not sure on how I developed this trading plan then I would highly advise you to check out this video which is another video in the A2Z guide which will tell you everything you need to know alright perfect thank you thank you thank you

## <p>allow me to explain exactly what I think is wrong with the trading industry nowadays everyone is so vague they say stuff like if you see it you can't unsee it stuff like that like what do you even mean Define seeing it what is it Define it and that is exactly what is wrong people love to figure out an algorithm people love to get tricked and stay focused on figuring out an algorithm again you know what I say I always say are you here to figure out an algorithm or are you here to make money and that's exactly why I created the money making team in the first place because a lot of people tend to lose the objective of why they came into trading in the first place it was to make money and of course to have freedom and freedom and money they are pretty correlated I could say they go hand in hand so what do I mean with vague and how can we not be vague we need to Define things so we need to objectively look at certain things and how can we make this object how can we Define it quantifiable how can we look at something and know all right this is a breaker this is a dealing range this is an order block this is my trading setup this is my entry pattern that is what the trading industry is missing it's vague it's this algorithm it's this it's this weird obsession with an algorithm the reason I say that the reason I go on this little rent it's very important for you to hear and the reason I want you to hear that is because now you need to pay attention throughout the A to Z guide I've mentioned it before everything I do is very much definable we can objectify a lot of things it's a lot of step-by-step Manner and that's exactly how I operate so in this video especially I will show you how to trade with dealing ranges I will show you exactly how to incorporate them into your trading plan because that's also what a lot of people are missing in the trading industry they show you Concepts but they don't tell you how to incorporate them because they don't actually know how to themselves the most important rent of your life right there let's get into the topic so dealing ranges what exactly is a dealing range how can we objectify this dealing range a dealing range is a range that took out buy-site liquidity and then it took out cell cycle or vice versa it took out South Side liquidity and then buys that liquidity what exactly is Buy sell liquidity again buy side liquidity is liquidity above the market so if we have current market price right here then everything above it right here this is buy side liquidity everything below it is sell side liquidity right there now we can Define it even more because Buy sell liquidity and sell side liquidity is still very vague right how can we Define it even more buy side liquidity is Swing highs sales ad liquidity is Swing lows so these swing highs that is exactly buy side liquidity these swing lows right there that is your sell side liquid so what we just mentioned was a dealing range is a range that took out buysite liquidity and then took out sell side liquidity so for example right here we have this range let me Mark it with my Fibonacci right here this is a range right is it a dealing range though it took out buy side liquidity to the left because it took out swing highs right did it take out sell side liquidity no it didn't so it's not a dealing range this right here took out buy side liquidity this candle and we took out salsa liquidity is that a dealing range yes it is so in this case what would you do you would Mark out the buy side liquidity right there that it took out and the sell side liquidity right there and this exact thing is your dealing range Buy sell liquidity taken sell side liquidity taken you could make the argument that it's somewhat of a breaker but I will show you how it is very useful that dealing range in a trading plan so that is our first dealing range now what do we see next when we continue lower what happens here is this a dealing range this High to that low no it's not a dealing range but what happens after we sweep That Swing high right there this one right there and then what is the next sell side liquidity that we are taking we first off have this already because that's obviously a swing low so we have objectified it that is the first dealing range that we have right there then the second the bigger one we could argue all right we also have this bigger dealing where we have this buy solid liquidity and dead cells I look good that is another dealing range what happens after right here we also have a new dealing range Can you spot this one also a dealing range what happens after we also have a new dealing range right there buys a liquidity taken sell side liquidity take again defining objectifying Buy sell liquidity swing highs objectifying sales liquidity between lows but leading up to those bearish dealing ranges we had right there we also have bullish dealing rates to work with so what can we see right here what happened we take out cell site liquidity right there again sales liquidity swing lows or one swing low can also be one swing low then afterwards we take out Buy sell liquidity Buy sell liquidity swing highs right here your swing high right there your swing lows sales are liquidity buys a liquidity after that we move back into the dealing range right there and then we continue higher is this a dealing range right here no it's not why because it didn't take selfie liquidity now does it mean that just because this isn't a dealing range that it won't hold no absolutely not that doesn't mean that's not what I'm implying here I'm just showing you how you can get to a mechanical trading plan using dealing ranges if you prefer that again reminder the A to Z guide here is to show you options of what you could use and you can form your own trading plan using this so if you love dealing races and you find dealing ranges very easy to spot that is exactly what you want to be using so right here we have a new dealing range right we took our sales adequately right there and we took our buy side liquidity right perfect we have somewhat of a new dealing range then the dealing range fills now you could incorporate a new thing what if we add the rule the dealing range has to have a bullish fair value gap for bullish dealing range we have to have a bullish forever Gap alright perfect let's take a look so right here we have a new dealing range to cut sales aliquity then here we took out buy side liquid and we have a fair value Gap sitting right there perfect that is our dealing range with dead cell site liquidity right there all right and we follow price we follow price and then eventually we reach that drone liquidity right there so I think you get the idea of what a dealing range now is now let's look at how we can implement this into our trading plan and how we can actually use it in an objective way now first off I need you to understand that this is also applicable to every market so I'm currently showing you Forex but it will also work on indices allow me to show you the best way of using dealing ranges in my opinion right here we are expending lower on The Daily time frame right there right we are coming into that daily fair value Gap right there with a previous day high sweep right there if we now go into the 15 minute time frame once we reach that daily fair value Gap that is exactly when we want to look for 15 minute dealing ranges the thing I'm saying here to you is you need context behind your rate and this is also a very vague subjective topic that a lot of people talk about yes you need narrative you need context what is narrative what is context Define it it is not quantifiable a lot of people just throw out words into the world like Define it it doesn't make sense and if someone is not able to Define it then just know they likely don't have a clue what they're talking about so allow me to define context Define narrative for you narrative and context starts on the higher time frame The Narrative you are seeing here is that we are coming that daily fair value Gap when we are moving from a daily fair value cap in this case a premium array the price will now seek a new discount array because price moves from premium to Discount and from discount to premium a premium array what is a premium array we have this daily fair value Gap right there and we have this previous day high but the most important part part is that daily fair value Gap right there that is a premium array where's the first discount array the first discount array is right here so this gives us our context our narrative in between this premium array and in between that discount array this little area right there that is where we want to look for 15 minute dealing ranges so this gives us our context based on the higher time frame The Narrative on the higher time frame is right there it's moving from premium array to Discount array so there is context there's narrative behind it so we don't get lost on the lower time frame trying to trade every single 15 minute dealing range that is not what we want to do so if we dive back into the 15 minutes we now have context behind what we're doing we have a narrative behind what we're doing the 15 minute doesn't create our narrative the 15 minute is just to get in sync with the higher time frame context with the higher time from narrative so we already have a place where we want to look for trades and we already have a place where we want to Target this is our Target right there that daily swing low right there what is the next step the next step is we are only trading dealing ranges so we only look at trading dealing ranges 15 minute dealing ranges right here until we reached that drama quit then we stopped looking at dealing ranges if we zoom in a little bit right here what do we see coming into that daily 5 Gap we sweep buy side liquidity right there and right here we already sweep South Side liquidity even a little bit higher you could say you could of course also say all right I take the bigger dealing range so I take this dealing range now let me first show you the smaller dealing range right here what we can see here and what we want to do is we want to enter at the low of that dealing range of course if it's a bearish dealing range so right here that could be an entry with a fair value Gap as well that is a perfect entry right there what would you do you place your stop above the dealing range and you target the Target we had established on The Daily time frame that is the first option the next option is taking the bigger dealing range a little bit more certainty maybe you are a person that wants a little bit more certainty perfectly fine then we wait a little bit longer right here the first thing we can see is we now break that low of the dealing range so we have taken sales adequity so there is a dealing range in the first place then again we enter on the low of that dealing range where do we place our stop loss above the dealing Range High right there where did we target we target that opposing daily discount array right there all right that is the second option what is the third option the third option which you see from an objective standpoint again could you see this as a dealing range right here this small little thing as a dealing range right there that range yes you could of course see that as a dealing range now what then happens is if we already moved this low would you execute on a small dealing range like that I personally wouldn't but I do agree I just talked about be it being very vague so if we make it objective let's say we took a loss right there so we took two winners and we took a loss right there all right perfect then we wait for the next dealing range what is the next dealing range we took by side liquidity here and afterwards we took sell side liquidity right there this is our next dealing range so we want to execute on that dealing range low right there the low is a little bit lower the wick right there cover what our stop loss is going above the dealing Range High starting what that opposing daily discount array right there that is using dealing ranges how you can get to a train so let's take a look at another example all right so here we are on EU on The Daily timeframe again what is the first thing we need to establish we need to establish context and narrative what is the context what is the narrative well we already have a bigger dealing range right here on the daily time frame actually that's pretty funny because then we have a fractal dealing range right here and the thing I've marked up right here is a weekly fair value Gap this dealing range what can it do it can deliver into that Weekly verify Gap because of course the weekly favor Gap will be a very strong magnet it's pulling price towards that Weekly for vice Gap in this case we also have a BPR right there a very small BPR let's just take the whole fair value Gap right there now again we dive into the 15 minute and look at our dealing ranges we haven't tapped into the daily for fire gap yet so there isn't any reason to look for dealing ranges just yet there we tap into the Daily Paragraph now my eyes are going and my eyes are scouting for a dealing range was there a dealing range right here you could potentially say there was we swept this swing high but we didn't sweep this Wing High We swept this swing high and then we swept this swing low let's just take the trade let's take the trade right there because I want to show you the reality of trading because these type of losses might happen to you and the thing is there is a losing curve in your trading this is what I tell the mentorship all the time the mentorship knows there is a losing curve in trading and the losing curve is where you first lose when you apply a new trading plan you first start losing then once you get that experience you see a couple of losses you are now likely a break even Trader then when you gain even more experience you start to taste the wins that is when you slowly start getting those profits that is a losing curve so you first start of losing then break even and then awaiting Trader but a lot of people don't get through the losing cycle they are always stuck in that first part of that losing curve where they lose they lose they lose and then what do they do they start strategy hopping Strat hopping shiny object syndrome Traders SOS Traders or the even more dangerous parties I would say where they first pass a challenge using a new trading plan a new trading strategy but they have only encountered wins they haven't had the losing part of that losing curve that losing part of the losing curve that draw down period it's going to happen it is going to happen I can tell you straight up front it's going to happen when you trade a new trading plan you will go through a losing phase that first losing phase will determine if you are an SOS Trader or not if you now start Strat hopping or not though some people get funded using a trading plan but they haven't gone through the mandatory losing stage just yet so what happens they are now funded they start losing and they think hey I shouldn't be losing trading is not about losing right who loses who's a loser you're a loser no no no I'm not a loser the market is not random we need to have 100 win rate this is very dangerous because when that happens when you have these kind of thoughts you will now look at a new training plan and you will have this endless cycle and you never get out of the losing stage and you lose your funded account because you don't understand risk management you don't understand sticking to one thing you don't have your psychology in check all things we are going to go over later on in the HC guide so right here this could be a loss all right perfect what do we see afterwards we continue we continue we do have some kind of new dealing range right there let's take it right there starting the opposing daily discount which was that swing low right there combined with a weekly verify Gap alright we take another loss minus two remember that minus two alright it seems like we might have a new dealing range to work with right here this is the load the cells are creating this is the buys a liquidity that we took right there right there we have a dealing range cover the dealing Range High Target that Weekly 45 Gap AKA That Swing low on The Daily time frame right there we are tagged in right there perfect we continue lower we continue lower then right there we have a new dealing range let's look at this we have a new dealing range let's just execute right here we execute right there we have this new dealing range right there and we target the lows again right there all right we took another loss so that is minus three right here we do have one trade still running right there there we have a new dealing range now we have two dealing ranges actually we have this small dealing range which you might have missed the trade actually right here you might have missed it right there but we also have this bigger dealing range right there so exactly there it's another trade covering what covering the dealing range a high right there targeting what starting that daily discount array all right do we get another dealing range all right here we have another huge dealing range actually right there we have another huge dealing range this huge dealing range that we have right here we again have that low right there this could be an entry right but the thing I do want to say right here covering those highs targeting again the same Target right there this is 0.6 RR is that worth it no at least a minimum of one to one RR I would say is worth it right here this is not worth it so that invalidates ID I wouldn't take that and we continue lower we continue lower we continue lower right there there we have a new dealing range targeting the same lows all right right there we got taken out perfect so we have a new dealing range here as well we have Buy sell liquidity right there taken sales allocated right there taken there it gets tapped in right there covering the highest targeting the lows and right there this take profit gets hit this take profit gets hit this Tech profit gets hit so let's actually count this 3.2 3.49 and 2.57 that is 9.26 if we of course subtract the losses from there so we took one loss right there we took another loss right there we took about two losses right there so that is around -4 but if I miss the loss let's say we are minus five all right so in these three days we are minus five but ho ho don't focus on the negative we are plus 9.26 that is Plus 4.26 for a stupidly simple trading plan and we haven't even Incorporated anything else just yet this was just dealing ranges and daily delivery you could say daily premium to daily discount daily discount to daily premium that's the only thing we incorporated here now imagine if we paid attention to kill zones if we paid attention to marked structure if we paid attention to order flow order flow is what I go very in depth on inside the mentorship and I can already tell you applying these things this loss right here would have been avoided using the kill zones already that is a minus one avoided these losses right there would have been avoided using overflow this would have been one of the very few losses so that brings us to a new end total of applying confluences and applying other things besides just the dealing ranges and the premium to discount discount premium we would come to a total of 8.26 for this single week now let me remind you you are now outperforming every single hedge fund in the world if you can keep the job consistently so the thing I wanted to show you here was that this trading industry is first off very vague people can't define a lot of things they can't seem to objectify it can't seem to simplify it this simple dealing strategy you can already tell it is profitable this on its own can be profitable now imagine if you only start using kill zones you only trade kill zones that takes away a lot of losses and the next thing is if you use the other Concepts some other concept you don't need to use everything you just use the kill zones and some marked structure and using the hard time frame zooming out zooming in you just use those Concepts combine it with dealing ranges just using dealing ranges as your entry pattern for example and that is literally all you need again I don't want you to trade this training plan first I have an idea of all the concepts that we are using first have an idea of kill zones Etc you need to First study a lot don't think that I just gave you the holy grail and you are now ready to go out there and trade no not Financial advice or anything don't trade this Trading plan please first study it study it a lot now if you want more information and if you truly like this then you will like the mentorship that we have first link in the description and if you like this then you will be absolutely mind blown with what we teach inside the mentorship again if you are interested you can take a look at that first link in the description alright thank you thank you for staying to the end and I'll see you at the next one thank you [Music] thank you foreign</p>

dealing range now is now let's look at how we can implement this into our trading plan and how we can actually use it in an objective way now first off I need you to understand that this is also applicable to every market so I'm currently showing you Forex but it will also work on indices allow me to show you the best way of using dealing ranges in my opinion right here we are expending lower on The Daily time frame right there right we are coming into that daily fair value Gap right there with a previous day high sweep right there if we now go into the 15 minute time frame once we reach

the world like Define it it doesn't make sense and if someone is not able to Define it then just know they likely don't have a clue what they're talking about so allow me to define context Define narrative for you narrative and context starts on the higher time frame The Narrative you are seeing here is that we are coming that daily fair value Gap when we are moving from a daily fair value cap in this case a premium array the price will now seek a new discount array because price moves from premium to Discount and from discount to premium a premium array what is a premium array we have this daily fair value Gap right there and we have this previous day high but the most important part part is that daily fair value Gap right there that is a premium array where's the first discount array

that daily swing low right there what is the next step the next step is we are only trading dealing ranges so we only look at trading dealing ranges 15 minute dealing ranges right here until we reached that drama quit then we stopped looking at dealing ranges if we zoom in a little bit right here what do we see coming into that daily 5 Gap we sweep buy side liquidity right there and right here we already sweep South Side liquidity even a little bit higher you could say you could of course also say all right I take the bigger dealing range so I take this dealing range now let me first show you the smaller dealing range right here what we can see here and what we want to do is we want to enter at the low of that dealing range of course if it's a bearish dealing range so right here that could be an entry with a fair value Gap as well that is a perfect entry right there what would you do you place your stop above the dealing range and you target the Target we had established on

then again we enter on the low of that dealing range where do we place our stop loss above the dealing Range High right there where did we target we target that opposing daily discount array right there all right that is the second option what is the third option the third option which you see from an objective standpoint again could you see this as a dealing range right here this small little thing as a dealing range right there that range yes you could of course see that as a dealing range now what then happens is if we already moved this low would you execute on a small dealing range like that I personally wouldn't but I do agree I just talked about be it being very vague so if we make it objective let's say we took a loss right there so we took two winners and we took a loss right there all right perfect then we wait for the next dealing range what is the next dealing range we took by side liquidity here and afterwards we took sell side liquidity right there this is our next dealing range so we want to execute on that dealing range low right there the low is a little bit lower the wick right there cover what our stop loss is going above the dealing Range High starting what that opposing daily discount array right there that is using dealing ranges how you can get to a train so let's take a look at another example all right so here we are on EU on The Daily timeframe again what is the first thing we need to establish we need to establish context and narrative what is the context what is the narrative well we already have a bigger dealing range right here on the daily time frame actually that's pretty funny because then we have a fractal dealing range right here and the thing I've marked up right here is a weekly fair value Gap this dealing range what can it do it can deliver into that Weekly verify Gap because of course the weekly favor Gap will be a very strong magnet it's pulling price towards that Weekly for vice Gap in this case we also have a BPR right there a very small BPR let's just take the whole fair value Gap right there now again we dive into the 15 minute and look at our dealing ranges we haven't tapped into the daily for fire gap yet so there isn't any reason to look for dealing ranges just yet there we tap into the Daily Paragraph now my eyes are going and my eyes are scouting for a dealing range was there a dealing range right here you could potentially say there was we swept this swing high but we didn't sweep this Wing High We swept this swing high and then we swept this swing low let's just take the trade let's take the trade right there because I want to show you the reality of trading because these type of losses might happen to you and the thing is there is a losing curve in your trading this is what I tell the mentorship all the time the mentorship knows there is a losing curve in trading and the losing curve is where you first lose when you apply a new trading plan you first start losing then once you get that experience you see a couple of losses you are now likely a break even Trader then when you gain even more experience you start to taste the wins that is when you slowly start getting those profits that is a losing curve so you first start of losing then break even and then awaiting Trader but a lot of people don't get through the losing cycle they are always stuck in that first part of that losing curve where they lose they lose they lose and then what do they do they start strategy hopping Strat hopping shiny object syndrome Traders SOS Traders or the even more dangerous parties I would say where they first pass a challenge using a new trading plan a new trading strategy but they have only encountered wins they haven't had the losing part of that losing curve that losing part of the losing curve that draw down period it's going to happen it is going to happen I can tell you straight up front it's going to happen when you trade a new trading plan you will go through a losing phase that first losing phase will determine if you are an SOS Trader or not if you now start Strat hopping or not though some people get funded using a trading plan but they haven't gone through the mandatory losing stage just yet so what happens they are now funded they start losing and they think hey I shouldn't be losing trading is not about losing right who loses who's a loser you're a loser no no no I'm not a loser the market is not random we need to have 100 win rate this is very dangerous because when that happens when you have these kind of thoughts you will now look at a new training plan and you will have this endless cycle and you never get out of the losing stage and you lose your funded account because you don't understand risk management you don't understand sticking to one thing you don't have your psychology in check all things we are going to go over later on in the HC guide so right here this could be a loss all right perfect what do we see afterwards we continue we continue we do have some kind of new dealing range right there let's take it right there starting the opposing daily discount which was that swing low right there combined with a weekly verify Gap alright we take another loss minus two remember that minus two alright it seems like we might have a new dealing range to work with right here this is the load the cells are creating this is the buys a liquidity that we took right there right there we have a dealing range cover the dealing Range High Target that Weekly 45 Gap AKA That Swing low on The Daily time frame right there we are tagged in right there perfect we continue lower we continue lower then right there we have a new dealing range let's look at this we have a new dealing range let's just execute right here we execute right there we have this new dealing range right there and we target the lows again right there all right we took another loss so that is minus three right here we do have one trade still running right there there we have a new dealing range now we have two dealing ranges actually we have this small dealing range which you might have missed the trade actually right here you might have missed it right there but we also have this bigger dealing range right there so exactly there it's another trade covering what covering the dealing range a high right there targeting what starting that daily discount array all right do we get another dealing range all right here we have another huge dealing range actually right there we have another huge dealing range this huge dealing range that we have right here we again have that low right there this could be an entry right but the thing I do want to say right here covering those highs targeting again the same Target right there this is 0.6 RR is that worth it no at least a minimum of one to one RR I would say is worth it right here this is not worth it so that invalidates ID I wouldn't take that and we continue lower we continue lower we continue lower right there there we have a new dealing range targeting the same lows all right right there we got taken out perfect so we have a new dealing range here as well we have Buy sell liquidity right there taken sales allocated right there taken there it gets tapped in right there covering the highest targeting the lows and right there this take profit gets hit this take profit gets hit this Tech profit gets hit so let's actually count this 3.2 3.49 and 2.57 that is 9.26 if we of course subtract the losses from there so we took one loss right there we took another loss right there we took about two losses right there so that is around -4 but if I miss the loss let's say we are minus five all right so in these three days we are minus five but ho ho don't focus on the negative we are plus 9.26 that is Plus 4.26 for a stupidly simple trading plan and we haven't even Incorporated anything else just yet this was just dealing ranges and daily delivery you could say daily premium to daily discount daily discount to daily premium that's the only thing we incorporated here now imagine if we paid attention to kill zones if we paid attention to marked structure if we paid attention to order flow order flow is what I go very in depth on inside the mentorship and I can already tell you applying these things this loss right here would have been avoided using the kill zones already that is a minus one avoided these losses right there would have been avoided using overflow this would have been one of the very few losses so that brings us to a new end total of applying confluences and applying other things besides just the dealing ranges and the premium to discount discount premium we would come to a total of 8.26 for this single week now let me remind you you are now outperforming every single hedge fund in the world if you can keep the job consistently so the thing I wanted to show you here was that this trading industry is first off very vague people can't define a lot of things they can't seem to objectify it can't seem to simplify it this simple dealing strategy you can already tell it is profitable this on its own can be profitable now imagine if you only start using kill zones you only trade kill zones that takes away a lot of losses and the next thing is if you use the other Concepts some other concept you don't need to use everything you just use the kill zones and some marked structure and using the hard time frame zooming out zooming in you just use those Concepts combine it with dealing ranges just using dealing ranges as your entry pattern for example and that is literally all you need again I don't want you to trade this training plan first I have an idea of all the concepts that we are using first have an idea of kill zones Etc you need to First study a lot don't think that I just gave you the holy grail and you are now ready to go out there and trade no not Financial advice or anything don't trade this Trading plan please first study it study it a lot now if you want more information and if you truly like this then you will like the mentorship that we have first link in the description and if you like this then you will be absolutely mind blown with what we teach inside the mentorship again if you are interested you can take a look at that first link in the description alright thank you thank you for staying to the end and I'll see you at the next one thank you [Music] thank you foreign

## <p>hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back this is the third video and this video we are going to touch on Breaker blocks breaker blocks are often confused with mitigation blocks last episode we talked about mitigation blocks and the type of pattern the mitigation block has now the mitigation block has a swing failure pattern now the breaker block as I've mentioned in the last episode as well are the breaker pattern obviously it's already a name breaker pattern and swing failure patternso swing failure pattern is for the mitigation block and a breaker pattern is for the breaker block so if we take our line tool right here let's say we have an up move right here we have a down move then we have another up move takes out this high then we have another down move takes out this low to the high and low gets taken then we move back into the low of this bearish breaker block and then we continue lower that's a breaker pattern and of course this is a bearish breaker pattern so the important thing for us to understand iswe are taking a swing high again if you don't know what a swing high is yet we'll touch on it later we are taking a swing high and we are taking a swing low and then we move back into that range this down candle if it's a bearish brake block we use the down candle and then we drop lower now if we want to draw a bullish breaker block it would look something like this so we have our low we create some sort of Swing High we take out the swing low we move back above the swing High the high right here the up candle getstraded back into and then we continue higher that's a breaker block now can you see the difference between a breaker block and a mitigation block the mitigation block would be somewhere around here because that's your swing failure pattern first breaker then after we might get a swing failure pattern and the logic behind a breaker block is pretty similar to the mitigation block if we are coming down right here and there are people buying this leg up so once we drop down below this low people who bought here get a chance tomitigate those orders so they get a chance to release themselves price is offering fair value after they had a chance to mitigate those orders price will drop off again now let's dive into a chart and give you some real-time examples as well alright so the first example right here is a bearish example we were coming off of some sort of weekly premium array now I'm going to basically emphasize more on confirming a higher time frame premium and discount arrays because a mitigation block an order block a breaker block every PD array isuseless if you don't have a higher time frame narrative a higher time frame bias so we need to have a higher time frame PD array and then in the lower time frame because the the same stuff happens on the lower time frame on the lower Terrapin we can confirm that PD array with another breaker block a mitigation block an order block Etc so weekly premium rate right here we are on the one hour time frame and you can see the pattern right here we are dropping lower creating this swing High right here a swing low we take the swingHigh immediately drop down below and we take this swing low as well then this right here this Wick that's overlapping with the fair value Gap this down candle becomes our bearish breaker block now the entire breaker block is the consecutive down candle so this is your entire breaker block just like an order Block it's the consecutive Down Candles for mean threshold it would be this right here the bodies of the candles and these ideally shouldn't get disrespected now there's a thing with means wrestled and I get this questionvery often mean threshold if it gets disrespected like this just a little close Above This doesn't mean that the whole ID of these Breakers invalidated the 50 the mean threshold is just an early indication that's all it is but the bearish arguments here are still stronger than the bullish arguments so there's no reason here to think if price closes just a little bit above it then the whole ID is invalidated that wouldn't make sense so remembered it it's not something set in stone it'sjust an early indication now we have the pattern obviously we have this breaker pattern we take the low right here because it's a barrier breaker block and then next step is something overlapping so as you can see there is a fair value Gap overlapping now this is often referred to as a unicorn setup a unicorn setup is a breaker and a fair value Gap overlapping with each other so at this low there's a fair value Gap overlapping with the breaker that makes it even stronger just like we talked about in the previous episode ifthere is another PD array overlapping with another PD array or there's something nested inside of here so here might be a very low time frame or block then that makes the PD array even stronger because then you have multiple confluences instead of having one and then you can see we move away eventually now what happens here this is a mitigation block swing fill your pattern it's coming back to this low this Wick is overlapping with a volume imbalance I would count that as a very Gap of course do your own testing see whatyou prefer and then after touching this mitigation block it drops off again this is your swing through your pattern so we had our breaker pattern right here then here we have our swing failure and this creates a mitigation block now again remember the steps and again a breaker block is strong especially with an overlapping for feiger if your bias is correct so if you know where price is trading to obviously obviously everything will be strong if we know where it trades to but without a higher time frame context behind anythingyou can have a hundred one minute time frame breaker blocks but they will not be strong if there is no context there's no narrative there's no higher time frame bias that's very important for you to understand and that's where a lot of people struggle with and it's relatable as well because I've been there as well in the beginning you're just trading the one minute and you're trading every break block you see without any higher time frame context whatsoever and you just get blindsidedand you're thinking why isn't it working well maybe you're not even looking at the higher time frame if we know the orders are on the high time frame why do we ignore the higher time frame that's stupid alright so let's move on to the next example right here we can take a look at the monthly actually and if we take a look at the monthly right here we can see we are coming off of this monthly order block if we then drop down into the four hour so that's already our context at monthly order block that's interesting to seesee how price is all fractal it's all fractal so first we have some kind of move right here but let's just ignore this bit right here and let's move on to this can you spot the breaker this last up move we create a swing high and we take out this swing low we Wick below it we have an immediate displacement higher taking out the swing high right here then this right here this little body the up candle is our breaker the wick isn't overlapping the top of the wick isn't overlapping with any of your value gapsso we take the body right here we trade back into it and we displays again so we have our pattern we take the high and what do we have an overlapping verify Gap making it even stronger and we have our bias already based off of the monthly so we have a monthly bias or for our lines with that bias we have a breaker block right there then if we drop into the lower time frame right in this section we can see the exact same thing it's all fractal so if we take a look at this right here this is our four hour breaker cominginto a monthly order block four hour breaker what are we seeing right here we're coming into this breaker for our breaker on the five minute time frame we're moving higher this Hive fails to take out this low what is this high after we take out this high right here this high is now not a breaker a mitigation block this is your swing fill your pattern breaker pattern swing fear pattern these are the only two patterns that are in the market that will tell if the market is reversing or not it's either a swing for your pattern or abreaker pattern these are the only patterns so let me write that down for you so it's either a swing failure pattern the mitigation block or a breaker pattern a breaker block that's all you need to know how to spot when a market is reversing these two patterns are the only reversal patterns so right here this is a swing failure pattern what is overlapping with this mitigation block we have this Gap this volume imbalance below it is a little fair value Gap and you can see we are pushing higher after thatsee how this video already gave a lot of information and the breaker is not that difficult to spot just train your eyes to see it and see it having it in the right context that's important see how we just had this order block we only knew about order block breaker block mitigation block and we just add a trade opportunity right here only by knowing order block mitigation Block Breaker block the only three things we talked about so far and we just had a trade opportunity right here see what I'm saying you don't need a lotto be profitable here the order block mitigation Block Breaker block already gave your bias you don't need to know a lot to be profitable now last example right here we're coming off of this previous order block like we talked about it's overlapping with a mitigation block and right here we are taking this swing high so we have the pattern we have a swing low swing High we take the swing low take the swing High bullish breaker as soon as we take so we don't need to close above it of course that's a nice Confluence to haveas soon as we Wick above this high this breaker block gets confirmed so we can already expect higher prices as soon as we trade back into it here we can already expect higher prices so pattern a high overlapping verify again see how we sting into the forefather Gap right there and push higher can you see how these three PD arrays the order block mitigation block break block already gives you so much context alright now for you please go ahead and study the breaker block see how order block mitigation block and breakerblocks already give a lot of context already can give you your bias and then I'll see you in the next video on Friday alright thank you </p>

Confluence to haveas soon as we Wick above this high this breaker block gets confirmed so we can already expect higher prices as soon as we trade back into it here we can already expect higher prices so pattern a high overlapping verify again see how we sting into the forefather Gap right there and push higher can you see how these three PD arrays the order block mitigation block break block already gives you so much context alright now for you please go ahead and study the breaker block see how order block mitigation block and breakerblocks already give a lot of context already can give you your bias and then I'll see you in the next video on Friday alright thank you

## <p>all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video about fair value gaps so if you were attending the live stream this past Sunday we were touching a little bit on how fair value gaps are creating a narrative now obviously there is a little bit more advanced but that live stream is a great video to watch after this one mainly the beginning of that live stream is where we talk about perfect apps that are creating a narrative again I'm live streaming on YouTube right here every Sunday at 8 30a.m New York local time so put your alerts on or either join the telegram where I announce the live streams link to the telegram is in the description alright so without further Ado let's get right into it so as you can see right here we have a few steps to go over first one being fvg FEG fair value Gap second one busy slash civi busy buysite imbalance cell side inefficiency civi sell side imbalance beside inefficiency BPR balanced price range liquidity void and volume aim balance all right so the first one being a fairvalue Gap what actually is a fair value Gap it is an imbalance that leaves behind an inefficiency in the market the market moves efficient so to deliver fair value fair value Gap if we have an imbalance on the buy side that means we are having a cell site inefficiency to deliver fair value we need to rebalance that buy side imbalance and deliver sell side inefficiency so what does a fair value Gap look like a fair value Gap is fairly simple right here you have one candle right here you have the wick so keep that in mind the top of that Wickso this candle that top of that Wick right here then we have 1 volcano that is expending higher this is a bullish fair value Gap then right here we have another candle that closes once this candle closes and it leaves behind only a body of a candle without filling in with Wicks then this creates a fair value Gap so this right here this box is a fair value Gap the fair value Gap is located between two weeks and it's a three candle formation always so once this candle closed doesn't matter whether it's up candle a downcandle once that candle closes that third candle it creates a fair value Gap now of course right here if we take a look at this for example this isn't a fair value Gap yes we have a body but there is no space between the first Wick and the second Wick there is no body in between there's no Gap so if you move a little bit further what do we have here we have a new fair value Gap right that is a verified Gap then right here we also have a fair value Gap right here you can see a verified Gap gets rebalanced right here doesn't have tocome all the way to the top it can already sting into it and then just go lower it doesn't have to rebalance it fully so you can probably see how price is navigating towards these fair value gaps all the time so right here verify your Gap right here for if I get right here for five Gap right here right here price is constantly navigating towards those fair value gaps so price is constantly rebalancing it is rebalancing inefficient price action and again right there is no premise to how big a fair value Gap should be this is also averified Gap this is also a fair value Gap the smallest little verified I get right here is also for very good even smaller this is also a fair value Gap as a long as the Wicks have a little body between them so right here there's a little body and the Wicks aren't overlapping if this Wick was a little bit to the downside right like this for example and there was no space in between then this wouldn't be a fair value Gap but now this is a fair value Gap all right now if we move on to the second one a busy and a city a busy buy sideimbalance so there's a imbalance on the buy side what does that mean this right here is an imbalance on the buy side and imbalance is the same as a fair value Gap and then a cell site in efficiency so there is no sell side delivery in that buy side imbalance or they go hand in hand when there is a bicep imbalance there is automatically cell side inefficiency so sell side needs to be delivered right there so right here buys that imbalance cell site inefficiency here cell site gets fulfilled so to make it even easiera busy is a bullish fair value Gap and you can make it easy right busy start with a B so buy so bullish fair value Gap CV starts with an S so sell so a bearish fair value Gap busy bullish forever Gap sebi bearish foreign sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency so for example right here cell site imbalance cell site verify your Gap a buy side inefficiency there is no price action on the buy side so right here that buy side inefficiency gets fulfilled then the next thing a BPR a balanced price range a BPR is toooverlapping fair value gaps so an overlapping busy with a civi what does that look like if we take a look right here this right here is a balanced price range and again all these five things essentially four because busy city is just a fair value Gap these can all be used as point of Interest or PD arrays that we can trade off of and a BPR is only the overlapping part of the two verify gaps so a bullish for Value Gap and a bearish for so if we take a look right here we have another one right here only the overlapping part is the part you wouldselect so for example right here it is a little bit overlapping so that is the only part you would select of course keeping in mind there's also a fair flag game right here there's also a BPR right here these are just a nice Confluence so that is a bprn overlapping busy and a city or an overlapping city with a busy now the fourth one is a liquidity void the difference between a fair value Gap and a liquidity void a fair value Gap there has been one-sided delivery meaning we have either a buy side imbalance or a cell site imbalancea liquidity void there was no buy side nor a sell side imbalance so there was no delivery of price action at all it is a gap in the market it is a liquidity void there was no price delivery at all so for example this is something you will see during news events heavy news events so I'm talking about US dollar fomc CPI NFP when these are high impact news events sometimes happen they leave behind a liquidity void on the lower time frame but if we take a look right here at the stocks stocks open up with a gap most of the time because there's noTrading right here the Mark is closed when they open up they are leaving behind a liquidity void so right here this part where there is no price action right here that is a liquidity void price has a very strong tendency even stronger than a fair value Gap what I would say so trade back into this liquidity void before continuing so right here just another example on the liquidity void this for example right here this little Gap in price action that is a liquidity void same for this little Gap those are liquidity voicethere was no price delivery on both sides of the market it just skipped a few price points a few price ticks this happens on Futures way more than on Forex pairs now for the last one the final one right here the fifth one a volume imbalance a volume imbalance is when there is a space between swing two candles so for example a candle should normally close right here and then open and they should be perfectly at the same price point right well this doesn't always happen and especially on future contracts so youwill see this less often in Forex more so on Futures like es which is the Futures contracts for the S P 500 and right here if we take a look and take a closer look this right here that is a volume in balance get right there there is a little bit of space between this close and this open of the candles so that right there would be a volume imbalance so if we take a look at the daily price action right here we have a few volume imbalances right you can see this one right there and we could see this one right there those are examples of volumeimbalances there is a little Gap right here between the bodies of the candles so this is a two candle formation and not a three candle formation now again all these things these five things basically four because BC and for Value Gap is the exact same thing these four things are the best when they are overlapping with another PD array that we have already touched on then they are the strongest and fair value gaps and liquidity voice and volume imbalances Etc they will tell you a story so if you are interested in that then you can takea look at the live stream especially in the beginning of the live stream that's where we touch on it alright I want to thank you study this and study how they form a narrative and I will see you at the next video on Friday alright thank you thank you [Music] foreign</p>

all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video about fair value gaps so if you were attending the live stream this past Sunday we were touching a little bit on how fair value gaps are creating a narrative now obviously there is a little bit more advanced but that live stream is a great video to watch after this one mainly the beginning of that live stream is where we talk about perfect apps that are creating a narrative again I'm live streaming on YouTube right here every Sunday at 8 30a.m New York local time so put your alerts on or either join the telegram where I announce the live streams link to the telegram is in the description alright so without further Ado let's get right into it so as you can see right here we have a few steps to go over first one being fvg FEG fair value Gap second one busy slash civi busy buysite imbalance cell side inefficiency civi sell side imbalance beside inefficiency BPR balanced price range liquidity void and volume aim balance all right so the first one being a fairvalue Gap what actually is a fair value Gap it is an imbalance that leaves behind an inefficiency in the market the market moves efficient so to deliver fair value fair value Gap if we have an imbalance on the buy side that means we are having a cell site inefficiency to deliver fair value we need to rebalance that buy side imbalance and deliver sell side inefficiency so what does a fair value Gap look like a fair value Gap is fairly simple right here you have one candle right here you have the wick so keep that in mind the top of that Wickso this candle that top of that Wick right here then we have 1 volcano that is expending higher this is a bullish fair value Gap then right here we have another candle that closes once this candle closes and it leaves behind only a body of a candle without filling in with Wicks then this creates a fair value Gap so this right here this box is a fair value Gap the fair value Gap is located between two weeks and it's a three candle formation always so once this candle closed doesn't matter whether it's up candle a downcandle once that candle closes that third candle it creates a fair value Gap now of course right here if we take a look at this for example this isn't a fair value Gap yes we have a body but there is no space between the first Wick and the second Wick there is no body in between there's no Gap so if you move a little bit further what do we have here we have a new fair value Gap right that is a verified Gap then right here we also have a fair value Gap right here you can see a verified Gap gets rebalanced right here doesn't have tocome all the way to the top it can already sting into it and then just go lower it doesn't have to rebalance it fully so you can probably see how price is navigating towards these fair value gaps all the time so right here verify your Gap right here for if I get right here for five Gap right here right here price is constantly navigating towards those fair value gaps so price is constantly rebalancing it is rebalancing inefficient price action and again right there is no premise to how big a fair value Gap should be this is also averified Gap this is also a fair value Gap the smallest little verified I get right here is also for very good even smaller this is also a fair value Gap as a long as the Wicks have a little body between them so right here there's a little body and the Wicks aren't overlapping if this Wick was a little bit to the downside right like this for example and there was no space in between then this wouldn't be a fair value Gap but now this is a fair value Gap all right now if we move on to the second one a busy and a city a busy buy sideimbalance so there's a imbalance on the buy side what does that mean this right here is an imbalance on the buy side and imbalance is the same as a fair value Gap and then a cell site in efficiency so there is no sell side delivery in that buy side imbalance or they go hand in hand when there is a bicep imbalance there is automatically cell side inefficiency so sell side needs to be delivered right there so right here buys that imbalance cell site inefficiency here cell site gets fulfilled so to make it even easiera busy is a bullish fair value Gap and you can make it easy right busy start with a B so buy so bullish fair value Gap CV starts with an S so sell so a bearish fair value Gap busy bullish forever Gap sebi bearish foreign sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency so for example right here cell site imbalance cell site verify your Gap a buy side inefficiency there is no price action on the buy side so right here that buy side inefficiency gets fulfilled then the next thing a BPR a balanced price range a BPR is toooverlapping fair value gaps so an overlapping busy with a civi what does that look like if we take a look right here this right here is a balanced price range and again all these five things essentially four because busy city is just a fair value Gap these can all be used as point of Interest or PD arrays that we can trade off of and a BPR is only the overlapping part of the two verify gaps so a bullish for Value Gap and a bearish for so if we take a look right here we have another one right here only the overlapping part is the part you wouldselect so for example right here it is a little bit overlapping so that is the only part you would select of course keeping in mind there's also a fair flag game right here there's also a BPR right here these are just a nice Confluence so that is a bprn overlapping busy and a city or an overlapping city with a busy now the fourth one is a liquidity void the difference between a fair value Gap and a liquidity void a fair value Gap there has been one-sided delivery meaning we have either a buy side imbalance or a cell site imbalancea liquidity void there was no buy side nor a sell side imbalance so there was no delivery of price action at all it is a gap in the market it is a liquidity void there was no price delivery at all so for example this is something you will see during news events heavy news events so I'm talking about US dollar fomc CPI NFP when these are high impact news events sometimes happen they leave behind a liquidity void on the lower time frame but if we take a look right here at the stocks stocks open up with a gap most of the time because there's noTrading right here the Mark is closed when they open up they are leaving behind a liquidity void so right here this part where there is no price action right here that is a liquidity void price has a very strong tendency even stronger than a fair value Gap what I would say so trade back into this liquidity void before continuing so right here just another example on the liquidity void this for example right here this little Gap in price action that is a liquidity void same for this little Gap those are liquidity voicethere was no price delivery on both sides of the market it just skipped a few price points a few price ticks this happens on Futures way more than on Forex pairs now for the last one the final one right here the fifth one a volume imbalance a volume imbalance is when there is a space between swing two candles so for example a candle should normally close right here and then open and they should be perfectly at the same price point right well this doesn't always happen and especially on future contracts so youwill see this less often in Forex more so on Futures like es which is the Futures contracts for the S P 500 and right here if we take a look and take a closer look this right here that is a volume in balance get right there there is a little bit of space between this close and this open of the candles so that right there would be a volume imbalance so if we take a look at the daily price action right here we have a few volume imbalances right you can see this one right there and we could see this one right there those are examples of volumeimbalances there is a little Gap right here between the bodies of the candles so this is a two candle formation and not a three candle formation now again all these things these five things basically four because BC and for Value Gap is the exact same thing these four things are the best when they are overlapping with another PD array that we have already touched on then they are the strongest and fair value gaps and liquidity voice and volume imbalances Etc they will tell you a story so if you are interested in that then you can takea look at

## <p>our value gaps are telling you a story and it's up to you to understand the story so allow me to explain what the fair value gaps are trying to tell you when you do understand the story that the fair value gaps are trying to tell you you can get to a draw on liquidity way easier you will understand certain characteristics of price and in general it will make your trading much easier to understand in a previous episode we already touched on it briefly that episode is in perfect harmony with this episode so to define the things that I want to go over I want to go over a sweep versus a run a sweep of liquidity is when price takes liquidity and then moves to the opposite liquidity a run on liquidity for example a run on liquidity is when we have buy stops right here and price just keeps on going that is a run on liquidity a sweep on liquidity is where this happens if we have buy stops right there then we have a sweep like that that story and the differentiator what happened between a sweep and a run can be told by fair value gaps alone and also if you do remember the episode when we touch on overlapping PD race I told you there's a certain situation in price when that doesn't always happen and when I would prefer only a sting into a fry Gap instead of coming into that overlapping video so that is exactly what we're going to touch on now let's start off with a sweep whenever we are sweeping liquidity the fair value gaps that were being created pushing into that sweep they will get disrespected and we will form an st model that's as simple as it is so you can notice a certain characteristics of course the context behind everything is important although the perfect apps on its own already give you a lot of context that is exactly why I love to work with fair value gaps so right here we have a daily premium array that was selected on the weekly forecast as well then once we have a move into that can you see what is happening right there that bullish fair value Gap right there that was responsible for coming into that premium array can you see what is happening there now based on the previous episode we have a beautiful St right there but the story behind that SC is also that we are disrespecting a bullish fair value gap on the other side that is the main characteristic of sweeping instead of a run on liquidity whenever we sweep and we immediately rebalance a fair value Gap completely that is not what you would want to see if you are expecting a run on liquidity if you're expecting a sweep then that's perfect so when I do refer to a run on liquidity can you notice the difference between this price action and the price action we just saw whenever we went Above This high right there how can we know if we were sweeping that high or is it a run on liquidity a run on liquidity has a high probability of respecting a fair value Gap that is overlapping with the high or the low that it just swept and with respect I mean that it continues higher off of that fair value Gap overlapping with the high or low that it just swept and we sort of have a small staircase higher we stumble higher right there can you see that we are stumbling higher now what was the main premise again behind St the main premise was that an st as a volatility so there is likely huge orders behind that move because it's leaving behind inefficiencies that can be set as well here if we are truly sweeping a high we are not staying above it for a very long time and if price is stumbling higher right there it's not moving higher fast it is slowly continuing higher and we are respecting that first fair value Gap there overlapping with that high then this retracement can already be seen as just a retracement and not a sweep so to define the characteristics of a sweep versus a run a sweep is when we have the St model so we disrespect we would have disrespected that bullish for fire gap immediately after coming above that high I would have seen an st model to the downside and a run on liquidity is when we respect that fair value Gap with the overlapping high and we immediately reject higher off of that then we can already know when this retracement happens that is where we can look to write the expansion higher again so we know prices are still bullish whereas if we go back towards that sweep once this happens we know that price is targeting opposing liquidity what is opposing liquidity opposing liquidity are these equal lows right there when we have a sweep so we have that St model formed price will Target opposing liquidity buy side liquidity to now sell side liquidity so if we take a look at this example on again EU after sweeping that low right there can you see what happens the fair value gaps are telling you a story right there and the fair value gaps are trying to tell you that this indeed is a sweep and not a run on liquidity because if it was a run then somewhere these for vehicles or those for Value gaps would have been respect acted and we would have seen a continuation on Lower immediately and then afterwards we might have seen a bigger retracement but right here this is already your indication that we are now targeting opposing liquidity in the form of these highs and even higher and even that high and even that high constantly when we are running highs what is happening we have those highs that are getting taken afterwards what happens right there even those equal highs right there we respect the first fair value Gap right there and we continue higher off of that now of course the whole context behind that is also very important after this sweep right there of a previous week low into a weekly for Value Gap that is your weekly Target all the way up there and can you see how fractal this is can you see what we just talked about on a 15 minute time frame here on the four hour what are we seeing after sweeping that load that we just talked about 15 minutes that's 50 15 minute is an early indication now right here we have our St end right there we have an immediate retracement into that fair value Gap and we are slowly climbing higher right there and that right there is your SD entry after taking those highs we are coming into that fair value Gap and we are not coming into an overlapping PD array we are only coming into that fair value Gap and we are continuing higher then right here we are taking that high again if it's a run then we will respect that high and that fair value Gap that is overlapping with the high that we just took if we saw an st lower and we were disrespecting that high then we would have likely targeted opposing liquidity in the form of those equal lows right there so that leads me to the next point when we are expecting retracement I am not always expecting price to come all the way back into an overlapping PD array and let me tell you why whenever price is close to the draw liquidity so what do I mean with close to drone quality we already had our St model right there we are continuing higher and we are now relatively close to the Drone liquidity and that ultimate drone quality I would not expect price to retrace all the way back down towards an overlapping discount rate to continue higher and that is again based on the same story that the fair value gaps are telling you a story because if we were to continue higher right there then this fair value Gap would likely get respected based on the sweep versus The Run theory that we just talked about if we had an st going lower right there and we had a huge retracement rebalancing that full fair value Gap then I would argue well I think we might even be going lower instead of going higher so again how can we Define that when we are close to the drawn liquidity and we already had a huge expansion higher I would not expect price to make a big retracement lower into an overlapping PD rate to then continue higher I would only and I would only demand off of price to come into that first Ferrari Gap and then continue higher can you see the difference between this right there and the difference between this we had an SD going lower right there once we have this St going lower that already tells me that we are likely heading towards those lows right there so again the fair value gaps are telling me a story now in another episode I will touch on a more mechanical manner of how you can know that we only sting into one fair value Gap and are not coming into an overlapping period but in order for us to go over that mechanical manner I first need to go over a different aspect that is required for you to learn that mechanical manner if you understand how the fair value gaps are telling you a story then you need to try trading es because es is an absolute Beauty now again this works on every Market but yes is is so beautiful believe me after sweeping that low again how can we know it was a sweep what is forming right there what did we touch on in the previous episode an st can you see now why this was a perfect entry as well because they're formed in St right there and we were already disrespecting that fair value Gap and not continuing lower off of that fair value with the overlapping load that we just traded below now this is actually a part that I mentioned in the Discord in the mentorship when we went Above This high right there and we respected that fair value Gap so we traded into that fair value Gap and respect that high as well because we were immediately continuing higher off of this provide Gap overlapping with the height that we just went above then this move right there this move already told me that we are now heading towards the next draw liquidity which was those eyes right there again can you see the difference sweep run run respect verified overlapping with the high sweep disrespect verify Gap overlapping with the low and St model forms and if you follow along with es what happens right there we come above this high that drawn liquidity and what happens afterwards we create some kind of First St but what happens again that fair value Gap with what overlapping that high the same process over and over and over now why didn't we respect this fair value Gap right there and this is where the part comes in that we just talked about when I expect a sting we haven't taken the draw liquidity just yet and we are close to the drama query just like you saw here close to the Drone liquidity only a sting and we move higher right there we have taken the Drone liquidity so again you can define it we've taken the Drone liquidity so overlapping PD Ray one of the first overlapping PD Ray got verified Gap with that high which is a mitigation block with that fair value Gap that is exactly what you want to look for that is how you can build on the ID of the fair value gaps are telling you a story but they are whispering and you need to listen very closely to what they're telling you and with those guidelines for example a sting we have momentum drawn liquidity hasn't been taken yet we are close to it though alright we only expect a sting I wouldn't want a big retracement after taking the draw liquidity are we sweeping or are we running that liquidity that is exactly being told by the fair value gaps as well that are overlapping with that PD array and the beauty array is that high or that low that we just went above or below and the same thing happens over and over and over now please don't just listen to me and binge watch these videos please do some studying on your end and you will be absolutely mind blown on the material that we are teaching here because you know what they say once you see it you can't unsee it Define it well with it I would define all the concepts that I'm teaching here and you can see how this is in perfect harmony with your St model if you found this interesting I would highly suggest you to go to oreo.io sign up for the newsletter right there it's completely free every week I send out new emails with new information if you haven't watched the St model just yet or if you have watched it I would highly suggest you to watch it again and see how it is imperfect harmony with this video right alright thank you thank you [Music]</p>

## <p>all right hello everyone I hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video we are going to be touching on rejection blocks so we've had breaker blocks mitigation blocks and Order blocks that's a lot of block now like I said as well you don't need to know every concept to become profitable so just pick out a few Concepts that you like and then stick to them because this is the only way you can actually reach Mastery if we truly want that intuition that God feeling to take over and we areconstantly hopping from this concept to that concept to this concept to that concept then we are not submitting to time and we are not allowing that intuition at a Mastery to eventually take over and that's very important for you to understand and this might be a little rant but if you're not listening to these rents and you're just here for the concept and that won't help you because trading is not about Concepts the concepts are your guidelines they are your toolbox but at the end of the day it all comes down topsychology and sticking to one thing is all about psychology it's not about Concepts alright without further Ado let's talk about rejection blocks right here rejection blocks are fairly simple a rejection block and the way I like to see them is when we do have a long Wick at the top or at the bottom for example this right here we have a long Wick then we might not sweep above so we might not take out this whole Wick before we continue lower why is this well we know generally and especially when we'retrading cfds then every broker will have a little bit of a different price action but generally on these Brokers the bodies will be the same because that's where the most volume of the trading is going to happen and the Wicks the Wicks are purely for manipulation so the Wicks are to take you out they are there to manipulate price and the bodies tell the story so the liquidity is actually above the bodies not necessarily the Wicks so right here if we take a look at this example we take the highest candle sothis is the highest gonna wear it as a close or the open this is the highest candle that is your rejection block now the reason I like it the most is because we have this long Wick that's when I do like a rejection block the most when there's a long Wick so you can see price here swept above this body and then drop lower it's taking out or it's even tricking in new people and then it's doing the exact opposite so breakout Traders got long here and people their stop losses got taken out before the real move happens now asyou might notice rejection blocks are mainly on the outside so they are either all the way at the top or either way all the way at the bottom not necessarily in between price not in the middle somewhere so this right here when we trade above the body but not above the wick and most of the time we trade inside this long Wick and then we drop off alright so this is a bearish rejection block again you take the highest candle now if we take a look at a bullish rejection block I can already see one right here right herethe lowest candle it's a rejection block as well it sweeps the bodies but not the wick again it's a long Wick that's when I like to use rejection blocks when it's a long week and as well as you may notice the main Trend right here was bearish right we were going down obviously hindsight 2020 Vision but the main Trend was going down generally when we are moving against the trend so this is also the opposite Trend move right here a counter Trend move then we will not always sweep below the low wewill generally respect rejection blocks more again that's for yourself and see if you like it and then maybe you can look to implement so right here same thing right rejection block right here the lowest candle we sweep below the body but not below the wick then we continue higher again a pretty long Wick as well and same thing like we just mentioned it's going against the trend so it will not always take out this low of the wick it might just respect the rejection block right here and as well it's an outsidercandle it's sort of at the bottom instead of somewhere like here in the middle for example same as here somewhere at the bottom it made a swing low which we'll get into later on and then we respect the rejection block and continue higher alright last example right here another bearish example same exact thing right the highest candle in this case the down closed candle is a little bit higher so the open of the down close candle is a little bit higher than the close of that up candle again long Wick it's onthe outside it sweeps the bodies and then continues lower so that's mainly all there is to it don't over complicate it this is literally all you need to know about rejection blocks so go ahead and study them for yourselves and I'll see you in the next one alright thank you thank you foreign [Music]</p>

all right hello everyone I hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video we are going to be touching on rejection blocks so we've had breaker blocks mitigation blocks and Order blocks that's a lot of block now like I said as well you don't need to know every concept to become profitable so just pick out a few Concepts that you like and then stick to them because this is the only way you can actually reach Mastery if we truly want that intuition that God feeling to take over and we areconstantly hopping from this concept to that concept to this concept to that concept then we are not submitting to time and we are not allowing that intuition at a Mastery to eventually take over and that's very important for you to understand and this might be a little rant but if you're not listening to these rents and you're just here for the concept and that won't help you because trading is not about Concepts the concepts are your guidelines they are your toolbox but at the end of the day it all comes down topsychology and sticking to one thing is all about psychology it's not about Concepts alright without further Ado let's talk about rejection blocks right here rejection blocks are fairly simple a rejection block and the way I like to see them is when we do have a long Wick at the top or at the bottom for example this right here we have a long Wick then we might not sweep above so we might not take out this whole Wick before we continue lower why is this well we know generally and especially when we'retrading cfds then every broker will have a little bit of a different price action but generally on these Brokers the bodies will be the same because that's where the most volume of the trading is going to happen and the Wicks the Wicks are purely for manipulation so the Wicks are to take you out they are there to manipulate price and the bodies tell the story so the liquidity is actually above the bodies not necessarily the Wicks so right here if we take a look at this example we take the highest candle sothis is the highest gonna wear it as a close or the open this is the highest candle that is your rejection block now the reason I like it the most is because we have this long Wick that's when I do like a rejection block the most when there's a long Wick so you can see price here swept above this body and then drop lower it's taking out or it's even tricking in new people and then it's doing the exact opposite so breakout Traders got long here and people their stop losses got taken out before the real move happens now asyou might notice rejection blocks are mainly on the outside so they are either all the way at the top or either way all the way at the bottom not necessarily in between price not in the middle somewhere so this right here when we trade above the body but not above the wick and most of the time we trade inside this long Wick and then we drop off alright so this is a bearish rejection block again you take the highest candle now if we take a look at a bullish rejection block I can already see one right here right herethe lowest candle it's a rejection block as well it sweeps the bodies but not the wick again it's a long Wick that's when I like to use rejection blocks when it's a long week and as well as you may notice the main Trend right here was bearish right we were going down obviously hindsight 2020 Vision but the main Trend was going down generally when we are moving against the trend so this is also the opposite Trend move right here a counter Trend move then we will not always sweep below the low wewill generally respect rejection blocks more again that's for yourself and see if you like it and then maybe you can look to implement so right here same thing right rejection block right here the lowest candle we sweep below the body but not below the wick then we continue higher again a pretty long Wick as well and same thing like we just mentioned it's going against the trend so it will not always take out this low of the wick it might just respect the rejection block right here and as well it's an outsidercandle it's sort of at the bottom instead of somewhere like here in the middle for example same as here somewhere at the bottom it made a swing low which we'll get into later on and then we respect the rejection block and continue higher alright last example right here another bearish example same exact thing right the highest candle in this case the down closed candle is a little bit higher so the open of the down close candle is a little bit higher than the close of that up candle again long Wick it's onthe outside it sweeps the bodies and then continues lower so that's mainly all there is to it don't over complicate it this is literally all you need to know about rejection blocks so go ahead and study them for yourselves and I'll see you in the next one alright thank you thank you foreign [Music]

## <p>all right no time for intros let's get straight into it you all know I hate riddles I hate people that talk in Mysteries and in riddles I think it's and I think we just need to get straight to the point so let's do that right here now our touch on the entries again in a more advanced manner but first off you need to understand that everything I'm talking about here is fractal so the plot the lot Etc can be applied to the Daily to get your drama quilty but a lot of people haven't thought of using that as your entry on the lower time frame so that can also be applied to the one minute time frame and then you have your entry and then you have your stop loss it's all a fractal thing the way you get to your entry pattern is the same way you get to your drone liquidity but once you have that drawn liquidity then the lower time frame is just to get in sync with price on the higher time frame that's all it is so if you have a slot on the higher time frame then you look for your external internal and then you have your flat on your lower time frame and that is exactly your entry and that is just to get in sync with the higher time frame there's a higher time frame here does the work for us so to make it even more advanced let's dive into this bit of price action we are on ES but again I'm not only trading es I trade Forex as well I trade indices I trade at your crypto I don't really trade Commodities but the same stuff applies to every single Market it is all the same so whether you are trading stocks Futures whatever you feel like everything I'm talking about works on that now once we get into the element of time so into the kill zones it is a little bit different but generally it's still the same but you will hear me mention it if something is or a specific Market so if we take a look at es right here we swept That Swing Low what is That Swing Low That Swing Low is a liquidity pool right the swing lows and swing Highs are how we can objectively look at liquidity pools now when we look at that liquidity pool and because we are trading with a liquidity Theory right when we are coming below that low and we are trading with liquidity Theory what should happen do you think institutions will be happy with price going below that low even further if institutions are truly buying below that low then do we not expect some sort of rejection that is the whole logic behind our Theory liquidity so if institutions are truly buying below that low then we should see some form of rejection ideally we should not stay below that low long and again that is a fractal concept that is for every single time frame if we have a turtle soup entry then we should not stay below or above a high very long and that's the same for inside a fair value Gap that's the same for inside a order block because these type of things the fair value Gap the order block to break a block the mitigation block it is all based around liquidity that's what you need to understand so when it is based around liquidity and we are looking and institutions are looking to buy at a new order block or take old orders off that is liquidity so we will not waste any time staying there so we want to see a rejection now how can we see a rejection now next part is where I want you to take notes because this is in a step-by-step manner but you need to take notes to actually develop that step-by-step Manner and to see it for yourself so if we dive into this price action right here we can already see some kind of rejection right here but the next thing is we are going in with the premise that institutions are not wasting any time below that low and they will want to buy immediately so if they are truly buying price will go higher almost instantly maybe a little consolidation but it won't waste any time below that low that's very important to understand that this is very key so if we drop into the 15 minute and take a look at this low right here we swipe this low and again what happens on the 15 minute right here that's irrelevant that it's not relevant to the left not relevant all that it was relevant was the daily swing low so right here we see what we are not wasting a lot of time price is rejecting a higher now how can we make this rejection somewhat objective well I'm glad you asked so right here we have that load this is your swing low right if institutions are buying what will we do we will come back Above That Swing Low how will we come back Above That Swing Low ideally with some form of displacement an energetic price move up how can we objectify displacement a fair value Gap that is your displacement so the only thing that you essentially need to be Scouting For here is a fair value Gap up that we have right there in that leg now it could have also happened in this leg but it didn't so in this leg that is more than enough we swept this low and yes there are some equal lows yes this looks like consolidation but again the higher time frame premise will not care about self-site liquidity if the higher time frame drawn liquidity is biased on liquidity the market doesn't give a about this consolidation when we are clearly aiming for buy side liquidity on the higher time frame so if we take a deeper look into this what did I just say I said all right if we are coming into a swing low in this case so a liquidity pool on the higher time frame and we are looking at a discount rate so there's a higher time frame this country then we want to have a sweep of That Swing Low of course but then we want to displace above it again so a move above it and a displacement those are two steps and I'll go into order block verify Gap as well don't worry but right here what do we see a move back Above That Swing Low so we could argue all right institutions might really be buying now we want to have another Confluence what is that next Confluence a displacement displacement is volatility in the market if institutions are truly buying and they really have big orders then they will 100 have some kind of volatility some kind of displacement so displacement how can we objectify it but you will hear a lot of times is just oh yeah it's just an energetic move just an energetic move come on what the is an energetic move what do you actually mean well let me objectify that for you because I had the same exact thing an energetic move is a fair value Gap that is how we can objectify the displacement so right here what do we see if we dive a little bit more deeper into it external remember what we talked about in the previous episode external and then what do we have next we break that high and what do we see we have external two here internal and this is also a swing failure this swing High failed to take out those swing lows right there swing filler with displacement in the leg higher all that is really relevant and the beauty of it you don't need to know a lot here all you need to see is that fair value get higher that is the thing I want you to understand now now inside the mentorship we have something called an st AKA sharp turn a beautiful Concept in my opinion that I use all the time to spot Market reversals Etc but the thing here that is important is that fair value Gap higher so these steps right we came below that swing low then we came back above it again and then we have a fair value Gap higher then we have displacement higher now I think a lot of people if you've watched the flot and the last video you will already know where to enter and place your stop loss because that's exactly what I talked about in the flood in the last video but let me go over it again what is your first line of defense that fair value Gap you could take the overlapping swing failure right there so what is your entry right there so what is your stop loss where your last line of defense that shouldn't get broken aha that's all it is now what is your target well what did I say inside the market structure video if we are moving from a daily discount what are we moving to next a daily premium so if we zoom out a little bit what is the next daily premium voila that is your next daily boom now of course the higher timeframe picture is still going higher so we could even aim for these Highs but just keeping in mind that the first daily premium is that daily fair value cap that is the first premium array that we are encountering so you want to manage your risk accordingly when you know that that is the first premium array that we are encountering because we can hold to the moon but again we need to understand that we are playing with probabilities here and this could have very well just gone lower off that premium rate so at least be Break Even or take some form of partials now again risk management is also something we will get into don't worry so if we drop back into the 15 minute right here and we target that fair value Gap that daily for that Gap that is a one two three now if you can catch a one two three on a consistent basis week in week out then I want to absolutely congratulate you because your future is absolutely no need to worry about it you are outperforming most headshots and that is absolutely insane you can make millions with just a one to three you can make millions with just a one to two with just a one to one if someone is telling you that you need to have 10 in a week and that you need to catch 20R trades don't believe that that is absolutely not necessary it might look fancy but again always come back to this question are you here to look fancy or to feel your ego or are you here to fill your pockets and take care of your family and make some money that is what we're here for so like I always mentioned we are not trying to flip 10K account to a million no we are trying to make 10K consistently on a million account that is what we're here for when you have the tool the money will come no worries about it of course not Financial advice alright now this was an example of a swing low now let's dive into another PD array so here we are on gu again a Forex pair but don't let that scare you because the same thing happens on Futures on ES on NASDAQ on the Dow or on stocks or Commodities wherever you want it to work so if we take a look at this chart what do we see we have that fair value Gap right there on the daily time frame we sting into that fair value Gap and then we continue lower so we are moving from what from a premium array to now what a discount array now whichever low is a lower right here this is your first discount rate so let's take a look for 50 or 50 up perfect equal lows alright so this is your first discount array AKA your target so in between this price action from this one to that one that is where you want to get involved now let's dive into the 15 minute again and let's Mark the lows of the fair fire gap which is this right here now you can probably tell we have liquidity here we have equal highs right there and even more equal highs right there now now I want you to ask a question are these eyes even relevant when we just took a look at the daily order highs on the 15 minutes right there relevant when we already had an established drone liquidity based off of the daily or is it all extra stuff and unnecessary but I have to give it to you it does look fancy the equal highs that are going swept and then it continues lower but is it relevant that's up to debate but in my opinion they are not relevant right here on the 15 minute so what do we see when we are coming into that fair value Gap same premise right same premise I want you to focus on the open of the ffi Gap right there that is the open the low of the fair value Gap we sweep above it and then we immediately reject lower so we are coming back below the fair value Gap low or the fair value Gap open we have an external here and even a small external here and what do we see next we have an internal right there now if we use the first line of defense and the last line of defense method again what would be the case here now we could say oh yes this was a perfect entry but that is not an objective way of looking at it because then I would ask you why did you not enter right here because this in first case and in real time this is your first line of defense overlapping with that breaker right there so something along the lines of that would have been your entry and then with the last line of defense this would have been your stop loss now I'm not trying to be dick or trying to be rude or anything but can you now see that your questions about stop loss about entry they were already answered inside the videos so what is the step-by-step process here well we came above the fair value Gap open then we came back below it and then what we had a fair variable lower AKA we had a displacement lower right there we used the plot of their entry and we used a lot as our stop-loss so this Spike up would have been scary at first but it is not an unlogical move why not well we don't have a fair value Gap in this lag lower so this High could get swept alright now what is our Target actually well we already established that way beforehand right there is your target beautiful absolutely beautiful right now let's say that you didn't want to take this entry just yet and you were waiting that's perfectly fine that is absolutely perfectly fine because if we take another look what do we have here we have an external move here then we have another what internal move right there that could have also been your entry now the stop loss gets a little bit bigger here because this is your stop loss right now and your target is right there still a one to two that is absolutely beautiful that is more than enough don't let other people fool you that you need a 1 to 10 RR on every trade that is absolute so if you were to wait a little bit longer then this would have also been an absolute beautiful entry now for you I want you to study this I want you to study the steps that we are taking and what I want you to do next is go over an example with an order block so use the order Block open as your rejection line so the same way we are using this line that we want to see a rejection lower again use the order Block open or a breaker Block open or any other PD array and see the rejection for yourself and the steps that you need to take for you to enter for you to place your stop-loss Etc now after watching this video are you ready to dive into the markets no you are not again study this but keep in mind you are not ready to dive into the market this is a great basic understanding of what we are doing here but you also need some form of experience etc etc if you want insights as well during the week using these Concepts as well then take a look at the link in description there's a link to my free telegram where I give insights during the week as well alright study this take care and thank you foreign </p>

questions about stop loss about entry they were already answered inside the videos so what is the step-by-step process here well we came above the fair value Gap open then we came back below it and then what we had a fair variable lower AKA we had a displacement lower right there we used the plot of their entry and we used a lot as our stop-loss so this Spike up would have been scary at first but it is not an unlogical move why not well we don't have a fair value Gap in this lag lower so this High could get swept alright now what is our Target actually well we already established that way beforehand right there is your target beautiful absolutely beautiful right now let's say that you didn't want to take this entry just yet and you were waiting that's perfectly fine that is absolutely perfectly fine because if we take another look what do we have here we have an external move here then we have another what internal move right there that could have also been your entry now the stop loss gets a little bit bigger here because this is your stop loss right now and your target is right there still a one to two that is absolutely beautiful that is more than enough don't let other people fool you that you need a 1 to 10 RR on every trade that is absolute so if you were to wait a little bit longer then this would have also been an absolute beautiful entry now for you I want you to study this I want you to study the steps that we are taking and what I want you to do next is go over an example with an order block so use the order Block open as your rejection line so the same way we are using this line that we want to see a rejection lower again use the order Block open or a breaker Block open or any other PD array and see the rejection for yourself and the steps that you need to take for you to enter for you to place your stop-loss Etc now after watching this video are you ready to dive into the markets no you are not again study this but keep in mind you are not ready to dive into the market this is a great basic understanding of what we are doing here but you also need some form of experience etc etc if you want insights as well during the week using these Concepts as well then take a look at the link in description there's a link to my free telegram where I give insights during the week as well alright study this take care and thank you foreign

## <p>so getting funded and making actual money now why should you trust me you don't need to first off you don't need to trust me at all I am a private Equity Trader and I have been funded before I know what it takes I've also blown accounts I've blown challenges I've passed challenges I've been there all before now what I always like to tell people is just because I can do it doesn't mean I necessarily can teach it well because when someone can do it it doesn't always equate to being a good coach a good teacher so I would like for you to judge me off of the way I teach and what my students have reached so far because everything I have achieved is irrelevant if my students can't do the same otherwise I wouldn't be teaching so the money making team currently has over 1.7 million assets under management that I am aware of that is only the mentorship that is not the YouTube or anything I have also heard about people getting funded just through my YouTube so I think that is the best measurement to actually judge me because if I teach them and they can do it then so can you so that leads me to the first point is of course having the right Mentor this is a big topic that we talked about in the previous video having the right mentor and sticking to that Mentor now again it might take a trial and error of going through multiple mentors and finding the one you actually like again we can't do everything right the first time maybe I'm not even the right Mentor for you that could be the case maybe you don't like the way I explained perfectly fine but it is very important to understand that you're not changing mentors because another Mentor has a shiny object that you like Etc that's not the case and again that leads me to the first thing I mentioned I believe the best way to judge a mentor is on how they teach and what their students have achieved stick to the same Mentor that is very important that's going to help you in the long run because your Mentor is there to guide are you through the process and to keep your mindset in check to keep you accountable Etc then the second thing I want you to understand it is not rocket science so I'm writing down rocket science but it is not rocket science there's not some kind of secret sauce to it there's not a secret blueprint to it it's a very straightforward simple blueprint and that is what we will go over of course here now the third step is of course a firm a prop firm or if you want to trade your personal account again perfectly fine you can trade your personal account if you don't really like prop firms Etc perfectly fine then this step would not be a firm for you it would be a broker for you so finding the right broker for example IC markets again if you're in America might be a little bit more difficult but there are also great options for that every firm I mentioned right here every broker I mentioned right here I don't have an affiliation with them I don't have an affiliate link I'm just giving you advice so I'll try not to mention a lot of problems as well so you can do your own due diligence with choosing the right problem it is of course important to know how you are trading what kind of Leverage do you need now I always look for preferably a problem with a 1 to 100 but there are problems out there that have a different calculation on contract sizes so in that case you need to be very aware and you need to talk with someone of that problem just so we know we can understand that we are able to risk the percentage that we want to risk then as well look for a prop firm with no consistency rule a consistency rule is basically you need to use the same amount of lot sizes over and over and over if that doesn't happen then they can remove you from the account spreads slippage stuff like that is also of course important what I always personally do and what I would always advise is if the prop firm has a Discord just hop in the Discord and search for slippage spreads Etc and you'll find a lot of information about it as well of course if you're a bit in communities Etc then you probably already know some prop firms that people recommend Etc and but I would always advise is just stick to the known ones so the best known ones they have a reputation to hold High most of the time of course so they will actually try their best to do something now again sometimes you can hear a story about a prop firm and I think every single problem out there has their own stories and usually people always like to share the negative Parts because of course we're all humans and for some reason we always tend to seek out every negative thing it's a habit that most of the humans have and the reason I mention all these things is as well because I don't want us to use the prop form as an excuse and what I mean by that and what a lot of people do is they tend to procrastinate the hard work the prop firm 99 of the time is not going to be responsible for your losing streaks for your drawdown for your Loan account Etc so it's also important for us to understand that we take responsibility when I blow the account whether the platform screwed me over or whatever I take full responsibility when we take responsibility for our own losses then of course we are also responsible for our own wins and that is important because then we have control over both sides we control our losses and we also control our wins we control whether we will make money Etc so we take responsibility always we don't use a prop form as an excuse and that also leads to the next thing where I would advise you to not get caught up in the whole platform story and be very active in discussions and arguments about all these things just choose a well-known platform and I know you can think of a well-known platform I just know it a lot of people they try to procrastinate their hard work that they need to do how do they do that they do it by complaining again or by constantly focusing on regulation this is that endless arguments endless discussions and if you need more than a couple of days to find the right platform for you then I truly think you are procrastinating because you're finding every reason on why you should avoid that hard work for example sometimes I need to do some hard work and yes of course I sometimes look up to it as in I don't want to do it I would rather sit on the couch eat some chocolate look at my phone and I know when I am looking at my phone I can I can catch myself in the act because I know I'm not on my phone because I should do something on my phone I'm on my phone because I'm procrastinating the hard work I'm procrastinating the pain now the pain is of course an exaggeration but before you actually start trading a lot of people try to procrastinate the Pain by back testing by choosing a prop firm for weeks and weeks just do it the person that just has the guts to do it is the one that will will always win in the end of the day whether he has more knowledge than the other person doesn't matter it's funny because the people with the most knowledge in this industry don't actually succeed because the person with less knowledge just does it he or she takes the action and he or she will always win from the person that is always trying to avoid actually doing it you can learn a lot about swimming you can learn all the ins and outs but the person that just jumps into the water and almost drowns themselves but then learns from it that is the person who will be a better swimmer at the end of the day you can learn as much as you want about swimming but at the end of the day you need to jump into the water sooner or later so that is also you feel until you win because you will fill and you will blow an account and you will not pass a challenge you don't need to why is it this expectation that everything needs to be so easy that we need to pass everything in the first time and I think I can have an ID because it's always been told at us that if we fail we're not good enough we don't pass something we don't make it whereas in this case in trading in business in general if you feel good very good because you fail until you win you need to keep on failing now of course does that mean going into a challenge and just already with the mindset I am going to use 10 risk and I'm going to blow the account again then I'm going to do it again no you need to fill but you need to learn from those experiences so usually people don't mess up because their trading plan doesn't work again everyone can understand the technicals but people can't stick to their psychology and their risk management so risk management is extremely important that's the next step if you have the right risk management approach then there is no reason to fill literally zero unless something strange happens with the prop firm Etc there's no reason to fill but people when they go into drawdown they get scared and they up their risk eventually instead of lowering their risk you always want to lower your risk so you want to have risk parameters you want to know when am I dropping my risk to zero to five percent when am I dropping my risk even to 0.25 percent and yes getting out of drawdown is an extremely boring process it is but unless you have millions to spend on challenges which I think most of us don't then you want to apply proper risk management your risk management goes hand in hand with your psychology because why most people fail is because they can't stick to their risk management because they can't stick to their psychology they can't keep their psychology in check when you are starting to tilt so you start to Revenge straight over to it you start upping your risk you also mess up your risk management so risk management is a hand in hand with your psychology you are already 50 50 on whether the market will go up or down everything we've talked about in the HZ guide has only enhanced that 50 chance if you just aim for a one to two RR with around even a 50 40 win rate within the beginning you will likely not have a high win rate because you're getting used to a strategy so take your time using that strategy don't expect a strategy to have a 80 win rate right off the bat it took me years to get to that stage so 50 win rate one to two RR you can't fill you can't fill the only way you will fill is through your psychology or your risk management again if you don't have your trading plan set in stone then of course we can blame our psychology all we want but if we don't know where we want to enter when we want to enter then it's futile to blame psychology because that's not how it works but once we have our trading plan we know when and where to end enter Then you can only fill through your psychology or your risk management and again risk management psychology same thing there is no secret to it the biggest secret I would say is risk management and psychology again that's why sat is not rocket science so then again you feel and you feel and you feel and then you win all of a sudden and you start winning hey you're getting used to the strategy you see your intuition is slowly taking over you're seeing the result of sticking to something of submitting to time that is a beautiful feeling every challenge you feel you will notice that the next challenge you take you think oh I'm getting better at this I am getting better and it's not better as in and with improving and learning for from our failures I don't mean you feel and you take a loss and now you look to incorporate A New Concept a new shiny object no you stick to the same things but you just look at it and see all right I could have maybe done this I could have maybe done that but you don't let A New Concept come into your Trading plan that is not what you want to do you want to stick to the same thing fill fill fill win and you might feel 10 times before you win who cares the process is the most fun now again you might go from Step 6 to 10 immediately and you might not fail in between what happens then is that you will win very easily on the first funded account if you're not prepared and your mindset is not ready then you will blow that account and you will blow the next challenges why does that happen because then all of a sudden you're overconfident you're used to winning and you never experience the pain of drawdown and having to climb out of drawdown slowly that is something you need to experience it you need to experience it before you win or even scarier like I just mentioned if you win before you fail then just know that field that is likely coming it's coming your way so be prepared be prepared for the drawdown Etc and again this is also taking responsibility and know how trading Works trading doesn't work work because I tell you my strategy and you use my exact strategy and all of a sudden you're now profitable it's not how it works if it was that easy everyone would be profitable and again that leads me to the whole point it's not about the technicals if it was about the technicals we would all be millionaires right here but very few people know what it actually takes to be profitable which is failing failing failing failing winning then when you win it is again not being overly happy of course you can be proud of course be proud of yourself take a look back at all the challenges you've filled how far you've come be proud but keep the focus because this is only the beginning so when you win again you don't need to get a payout of 10 15 no a two percent payout is fine it's perfect just get that payout and that refund from the fee that you paid for that challenge and that is fine and then now you have a profitable business because you need to treat it like a business you start maybe with a small funded account whatever you can afford again not Financial advice or anything but you start with a small funded account with a business and if you're in the business space you can compare that to trading because in business it is not advised to pump a lot of money and invest upfront a lot of money if you don't even know there's a market for it if you don't even know if you're going to be profitable if you don't even know if there is revenue coming in so why would you do that with trading why would you spend thousands of dollars on challenges if you don't even know you're profitable yet if you don't even know you can actually pass the challenges Etc so the way you start a small business is by making the business generate cash flow itself and from that cash flow that you make in the business now you can up the risk and you can buy more Etc when you see that the business itself you are already profitable so if you want you can grow that business just by maybe what is it a fifty dollar investment you can get a funded account from that two percent payout and the refund you buy another one and then you repeat the process over and over and over now that will take a lot of time but again what else are you going to do what else is there to do just enjoy the process believe me I've been there the outcome isn't really not that interesting yes of course it's nice and I'm not complaining at all don't get me wrong but when I achieved it I felt empty inside to be honest I felt very empty because I tied my happiness to that goal I was like if I reach that I will be happy I will have everything I want in life and it was the furthest thing from the truth so now I know and I can truly say that I am enjoying the process every day I'm enjoying the process of whatever my goal is I'm enjoying it doesn't matter how long it takes I'm not rushing it I don't care how long it takes I just know I will get there every goal I have I know I will get there 100 and if anything I look at it on the long term I don't think oh I want to be eat this this in the next month I need to reach this in even a year a year is a very small time period it's not long take your time enjoy the process so what did we talk about business right treat it like a business a two percent payout is fine don't blow your account because you're trying to reach 10 Etc take it slow Rome wasn't built in a day always remember that and then again time submit to time and enjoy the process it is truly fun it's really fun to process if you know the right steps of course because if you're in this endless cycle then yes it's not really fun but if you take these steps then yeah it truly is fun and then the last step is never never SOS and what do I mean by that never fall into the Trap shiny object syndrome never if you do that I can guarantee you you will never be funded you will never achieve the things you want to and that is with everything in life and again that's not me trying to be rude but that's just a reality of things because I am talking from experience right there never fall into the shiny object syndrome cycle and these are the steps these are the steps this is how the money making team has reached 1.7 mil Plus in assets under management now of course I'm saying it like you just do it and why are you not achieving it of course it's difficult it is difficult and especially in this industry because you don't really know who you can trust is my mentor teaching the right things is he throwing New Concepts at me every week because he's just hooking me and again if you're not sure then I would always like to invite you to follow along with the other students and with the money making team that we have right here because you're in the right place and if you listen to my videos over and over and over you will have the blueprint you will have the mindset you need the only thing that is holding you back is time only time now again inside the mentorship as well we talk about a losing curve about the actual risk management about the psychology about a full fun of the approach but this right here this is all you need these steps is all you need this Friday we have a giveaway and the giveaway is not the typical funded account giveaway no it's something different so I would love to see you there and if not of course I'll see you on the Sunday weekly forecast perfect thank you [Music]</p>

year is a very small time period it's not long take your time enjoy the process so what did we talk about business right treat it like a business a two percent payout is fine don't blow your account because you're trying to reach 10 Etc take it slow Rome wasn't built in a day always remember that and then again time submit to time and enjoy the process it is truly fun it's really fun to process if you know the right steps of course because if you're in this endless cycle then yes it's not really fun but if you take these steps then yeah it truly is fun and then the last step is never never SOS and what do I mean by that never fall into the Trap shiny object syndrome never if you do that I can guarantee you you will never be funded you will never achieve the things you want to and that is with everything in life and again that's not me trying to be rude but that's just a reality of things because I am talking from experience right there never fall into the shiny object syndrome cycle and these are the steps these are the steps this is how the money making team has reached 1.7 mil Plus in assets under management now of course I'm saying it like you just do it and why are you not achieving it of course it's difficult it is difficult and especially in this industry because you don't really know who you can trust is my mentor teaching the right things is he throwing New Concepts at me every week because he's just hooking me and again if you're not sure then I would always like to invite you to follow along with the other students and with the money making team that we have right here because you're in the right place and if you listen to my videos over and over and over you will have the blueprint you will have the mindset you need the only thing that is holding you back is time only time now again inside the mentorship as well we talk about a losing curve about the actual risk management about the psychology about a full fun of the approach but this right here this is all you need these steps is all you need this Friday we have a giveaway and the giveaway is not the typical funded account giveaway no it's something different so I would love to see you there and if not of course I'll see you on the Sunday weekly forecast perfect thank you [Music]

## <p>the daily bias is the most important aspect about trading because if you of course can know where price will likely head toward the next day then it becomes very easy of course I'm stating the obvious there but today I want to exactly go over how you can get to a daily bias very consistently and how I do it as well and I will show you a few examples where the money making team has applied this concept and this week even made profit off of these Concepts again if you don't know the money making team is my mentorship team let's start off with saying that the entry model is completely irrelevant you can get very creative with your Edge model do whatever you like to as long as you get in the market for your daily bias what I mainly use and if you've been here for a longer period of time you will know that I love fair value gaps fair value gaps tell you everything you need to know because fair value gaps are the signs that price is leaving behind when price is planning to do something so what do I mean by that when price is moving higher and it wants to continue going higher price will have fair value gaps telling you exactly what it wants to do and those fair value gaps can lead you to your daily bias and all you need right there is to study the fair value gaps so whenever there's a guru who tells you a fancy concept about getting to your daily bias then just remember all you need is fair value gaps and can you trade without daily bias yeah you can but who will make more money the one trading with a daily bias or without a daily bias the one with a daily bias so if you're trying to trade without a daily bias ask yourself are you just being lazy or is it truly beneficial to you so how do we use these fair value apps to tell us what price will do if we study this piece of price action right here what can we see first off we can see that we are continuing higher right here price is leaving a sign behind because it's leaving a fair if I get behind right there that it wants indeed to continue higher so only having this fair value Gap right there is enough for you to take a trade off of because we're clearly heading towards this high now why are we heading towards that high well because if we read the fair value gaps how many times have we gotten into that fair fire gap that is sitting right there on the left once right there Then twice right there then a third time right there and then a fourth time right there and then here it got fully rebalanced right there does this fair value Gap seem to you like a strong fair value Gap no why not because if there was a strong verify Gap don't you think it would have already pushed price all the way lower somewhere around there it would have never retraced to it strong fair value gaps only need one single retracement towards them to to then expand or drop lower of course that's me stating the obvious but a lot of people don't read price action and they don't take it into account because when we see this we're coming into it that many times and we fully rebalance it right there then these days when we are leaving behind this fair value Gap dead right there you only expect a sting into the fair value Gap right there and you target what the price action where we have no fair value cups left because a lag without a fair value Gap in it is a weaker than a lag with a fair value Gap in it always remember that so this right there is your drone liquidity so that right there is your highest probability price action and then if we continue looking at Price a little bit further we have a fair value Gap there now what is happening there we are disrespecting that provide Gap why are we disrespecting it remember what we did right there with that for Value Gap we fully closed above that verify Gap what are we doing there we are fully closing below that firefighter Gap if price truly wanted to continue high right there don't you think this day would likely have a wick and we would likely see higher prices on that day already and would likely respect that fair value Gap clearly it's not a strong fair value Gap but I just told you that when you have a lag like this with a fervical in it it's a strong leg yes but you need to have your daily time frame in context of your weekly time frame so the weekly did have a very very Gap lower below that leg so that lag is already weak so how can you view that you have high probability and low probability high probability being whenever we have a lag with a fair value in it it's likely a strong lag unless and that makes it low probability we have a lack with a verify Gap in it but on the time frames above it there's a fair value Gap just below that leg and that is fractal that goes for every single time frame then the lag is low probability or of course when there's no fair flag up in the leg then it's also low probability so right there we are trading towards a weekly fair value Gap right there that Weekly Fair fire gap can act as two ways it can act as a magnet so price wants to navigate towards it and it can do what it can push price away again so when we look at this weekly favor Gap right there can you see the difference how we are reacting towards this weekly fair value Gap and that daily for flag up right there we are clearly respecting that Weekly provide Gap now respect and disrespect you look at it on the respective time frame that the Fairfax has formed because of course on the lower time frame we will have disrespect right there and now again it's attention to detail because here we are creating a fair value Gap right there that fair value Gap will it push price lower when we are coming into the fair value Gap the first we need to ask ourselves which one is the stronger fair value Gap the weekly is stronger because of course there's a reason why the daily needs to be context of the weekly because weekly PD arrays are stronger than daily PD rates so the probabilities are already in our favor their price wants to continue higher right here and that gets confirmed when daily pair value gaps right there stop following through lower because if this wanted to continue lower it would have made a new Fair variable lore because remember price are telling you signs on where it wants to go and the signs are the fair value gaps and afterwards we are seeing a new fair value Gap higher right there that fair value Gap again acts as a magnet and we can use it to trade off of afterwards we have a new fair value Gap higher so again what is the bias we are likely continuing higher ride then here it becomes interesting because what are we seeing right there we came into that daily for vegap once on that Wednesday right there and we had a long week and afterwards we take out that low that long width low right there and we come back again in the daily fire gap what is price telling you right there price is telling you right there that this fair value Gap is not strong enough to push price higher because otherwise it would have already done it on that day right there so this day and that day and that day and that day they confirm what they confirm that this daily is not strong enough to push price higher because compare this daily for Vega to that daily for Vega and to this daily for vehicle right there only one sting needed only one sting needed one two three four five six days before we expand higher who are you kidding not us because we know that for backup is not strong enough so if we are continuing lower where are we likely continuing lower from what are we seeing on the way down we created what a daily Fair Gap right there that daily fair value Gap is our premium array to continue lower from what does that create the premium rate to that discount array so there you create what your context what we hammered on so much and I can hear you think what you didn't really go into daily bias let me clarify that first off you need to understand day trading does not mean everyday trading daily bias does not mean that you try to predict every daily candle you try to predict the highest probability candles because when you can predict the highest probability daily candles then you know where to enter now if you want me to give you data data on my personal trading plan how I've been able to use this and outperform every hedge fund in the world and stick to the end and I'll tell you how you can get that data so that daily bias is again filtering out you're filtering out the high probability from the low probability price action if you are trying to trade every day then that means that there is no high probability price action and there is no low probability price action for you well there is but you are just not paying attention to it trading every day means you are neutral professional Traders know when to trade where and when to trade if you can't know where and when to trade then you likely don't have a trading plan set because that is what you need to know so the fair value gaps are leading you to your daily bias why because when we look at this price action again and we zoom out a little bit and we use the verify gaps that we said all right these are high probability for five gaps it was this fair value Gap and that fair value Gap that discount rate to that premium array right there is where you want to get involved that is when and where you want to get involved and then when we look at this fair value Gap right there that is again a high probability and that is where and when you want to get involved because you want to get involved in that discount array and you want to Target that premium array right there and then afterwards same thing goes for this favaga that is where you want to get involved and that is your target right there sorry to interrupt I'm currently editing this video and I just want to clear it up I just want to make it as clear as possible so what I'm trying to tell you throughout this video is I'm constantly trying to tell you you can use the fair value gaps on any time frame because we talked about the time frames being in context of the time frame above it right you have your daily incomes as a weekly weekly in context of monthly etc etc that's with every time frame so the fair value gaps they are acting as a magnet so you can trade towards them if of course they are on the higher time frame you would not trade towards a five minute or one minute fair value that's absolutely nonsense but the four hour daily weekly and monthly they are great indicators great fair value gaps to trade towards them and then once we reach those fair value gaps what can you do well then we can potentially trade off of them to continue higher or continue lower how do we view that and that is exactly what I'm trying to clear up right here how do we view that we view that by respect and disrespect whenever we are wicking a fair value Gap that is when we respect a fair value Gap whenever we are disrespecting a fair value Gap we are closing inside of it or we are closing all the way below it or above it and then of course I mean when we are closing below a bullish verify gap for example this Fair flag up right there that is disrespecting and whenever we close above or in a bearish verify gap for example this verified cap right there that is disrespecting again and respect is what we're seeing here this verify Gap that fair value Gap and that for Value Gap they are only wicking and why is that important the wick because when you can understand and we form a bias here once we have that first Scandal so you don't even need to be trading that first candle right and that's what I'm trying to tell you in the video as well you don't even need to be trading that first Scandal because when you wait for that week then all these candles the one two three four they are obvious they are obvious that they want to expand higher just based off of this day right there so essentially what you're doing you're sacrificing one day to know where the rest of the days are trading towards the same thing with this right here you would wait you wait here before I get being created it can act as a magnet perfect so we might want to trade towards it once we reach that we want to be careful then once we disrespect that this candle is extremely obvious why because there's a weekly Fairfax sitting just below that leg right there and with lag I'm just aiming at your swing low to the swing high that is a lag then the same here once we respect this right there we respect that fair value Gap these days are super obvious so you're you're sacrificing again one day to know all these daily biases right there once we create that daily before I get right there again once we trade into it then here you could take a loss right there but afterwards you recoup that loss by having a winner right there because this is already telling you weak verify Gap strong fair value Gap you wait this day that day that Thursday is where you want to trade that Friday is potentially where you want to be trading no Financial advice perfect let's continue with the video so how can you get involved all you need to do right there is look for a fair value Gap lower on the one hour time frame and you enter off of that so here on the one hour what do you do you wait for one fair value Gap and you wait for a second verify Gap right there and you cover the intermediate term high right there and you target a one to two because one to two is all you need and then eventually when you get used to the trading strategy then you can Target the ultimate loss but always manage risk means gong break even taking profits very important so here we are on GBP New Zealand dollar and this is where the money making team has capitalized on this move right here if we Mark out this weekly Fairfax Captain if we are continuing higher where are we likely continuing higher from discount array to the premium rate right right there so if we drop into the daily time frame you can see that at this moment right here we had a daily fair value Gap sitting right there now when we looked at this pair we were sitting right there and the thing we saw was the following we knew alright if the weekly wants to continue higher then right here the week he will continue higher off of this discount rate off of that fair value Gap if the daily wants to continue lower then we knew the daily will continue lower off of this fair value Gap right there but if the daily wants to continue even lower what will it do it will create a new fair value Gap lower right there so what did we see we saw that on this day so this is a Tuesday and we wanted to trade on that Wednesday and I'll tell you why if we Mark out that low right there and we go into the one hour time frame and here we are on the one hour time frame and what you can see is that once we trade into that low right there that is when we wanted to get involved why because if we Zoom back out to the Daily time frame what did we just do we prevented a daily Fair very Gap from forming which means that this high right there that is your Target because this lag lower does it have a fair value in it no so that lag is what low probability of holding what does that become that Weekly fair value right there becomes high probability of pushing price at least until that high and that leads to your what Your Daily bias just using what fair value gas so again if we'll take a look at this entry then right here if you use the fair value gaps again that alone could be an entry covering that low right there and targeting that high right there and then you get tagged in and eventually it hits take profit right there and here I use the fair value gaps to create my daily bias and I use the fair value gaps to get to my entry model and to my Target and you use the fair value gaps to go break even it's everything the fair value gaps are everything if you can understand this that is so extremely strong now I want to give you an absolute mindset shift and I want to open your eyes so please go towards oreo.io sign up for the email list right there and then on Sunday so this Sunday 8 30 a.m New York Eastern that is the 3rd of September I will personally send you an email throughout next week with my data so you can expect that email anywhere from Sunday 3rd of August to Sunday the 10th of August if you sign up before Sunday 8 30 a.m in that email you will get my data you will see how profitable I have been and you will see how much days I trade you will get all the insights it will be a complete mindset shift and again why does my data matter well I like to think I have a great idea of what I'm doing and that is backed up by having an investor and being a private Equity Trader so if you would like to follow in my footsteps or at least be somewhat successful in trading then signing up might be a great idea for you because I think a lot of people need that eye opener like I mentioned I'm out performing hedge funds so remember that remember the newsletter and I'll see you on the weekly forecast on Sunday perfect thank you foreign

## <p>the most dangerous conditions that you can get trapped in as a trending Trader are Seek and Destroy conditions now the name itself already tells you a lot right Seek and Destroy it's referring to constantly seeking liquidity taking people out of the market both sides of the market are getting taken out short Traders and a long Traders are both getting taken out in this episode I exactly want to go over how we can spot those conditions beforehand and then in the next episode I exactly want to go over Turtle soups and I want to go over how we can potentially capitalize on these conditions because as a Trader I believe you excel in either secant historic conditions or trending conditions it's not a one fits all type thing here we are on Australian dollar US dollar to show you my receipt that it actually is possible to spot Seek and Destroy conditions beforehand in the weekly forecast a heading into this condition the seek any short conditions this consolidation that you're seeing right there in the free weekly forecasts we already mentioned it and how we were able to spot it before it even happened was there are few conditions first off we took cell side liquidity so we took a major cell side liquidity right there the reason I say major cells are liquidity can you notice what this is this is already a big consolidation itself we take out the low of the consolidation right there that afterwards we immediately Target the opposing liquidity at the highest right there so we sweep the lows and then head for the highs in one big expansion higher right there in that moment what has happened we have taken both sides of the market price now needs to create and generate new liquidity in the market what then happens is if you draw your Fibonacci on that low and that high right there so just the range where the expansion happened the most recent range like a Magnus price will refer back to the 50 percent of that most recent range which is that that is equilibrium that is where price is in Balance it's not in premium it's not a discount it's at equilibrium and price will likely consolidate there now this is not guaranteed and the reason is not guaranteed it is guaranteed once PD arrays stop following through PD Rays not following through is the most important aspect to knowing when we have seek and historic conditions because taking the cells are liquidity taking the buy sell liquidity getting back to 50 of the range that's nice and all but to actually confirm so you can destroy conditions the last step before we actually can confirm seek and historic conditions that is when PD Rays stop following through what do I mean by that when we zoom in on this price action right there we have that fair value Gap that we are trading into and what is that for Value Gap doing right at that premium array is pushing price lower we have this fair value Gap right there what is that for valleycap doing that premium array again is pushing price lower then right there it is important first thing to note that we are at 50 so it's already getting tricky now the next thing is we have this fair value Gap and that order block sitting right there two premium arrays what happens right there we are not rejecting lower anymore can you see that and then we trade to the lows we don't take out the lows we immediately continue higher it is in Seek and Destroy conditions right there and why because the PD rays are not following through anymore the discount arrays are not following through the premium arrays are not following through and the beautiful thing you can notice on a daily time frame right there can you see all the Wicks there's no fair value Gap anywhere that is exactly what we would want to see or seek any store conditions or if you're a trend Trader of course you don't want to see this and you would love for it to never happen but unfortunately it will happen sooner or later you will experience these conditions alright here we are on the dollar and right here we again have seek and historic conditions there we take out a major liquidity pool what does price do like a magnet again it refers back to 50 percent of that most recent range and then to confirm the second short conditions what happens the PD rays are not following through any anymore so we have this sweep right there we have this fair value Gap that is not continuing lower no fair value gaps lower anymore no further gets higher either we just have Wiki price action and once you notice that the price is failing to follow through and you could have already noticed that very early on if you go back to an old old live stream I believe I managed it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday right there that I said alright we are in seeking short conditions and you need to be very careful and what I saw at that time so here we are zoomed in on the four hour what I saw at the time was if price wants to continue lower here then this fair value Gap should likely get respected and follow through right so once this happens we come into that fair value Gap right there and we failed to follow through and then we do come into an order block right there but there's no Friv going higher either right there PD rays are not following through so you want to either avoid it or this is your time to shine and this is exactly where you want to get involved now how can we know that the sick and historic conditions are over and that as Trend Traders we can finally trade again and that a sec and Destroy conditioned Traders we might want to get out of the market again when price displaces out of the range out of the consolidation that is exactly when we can look to trade it again what do I mean by that first off what is the consolidation the consolidation the major consolidation is this right here right it's this whole gray area that is your consolidation then the next part is what is displacement a displacement is a fair value Gap now you ideally want something on the higher time frame to create a fair value Gap not just a one minute fair value gap of course that that is not significant enough right there we have a fair value gap down but does it displays out of the consolidation no it does not so right there we have a new fair value Gap alright nice and here we have a new fair value Gap and it displaced out of the consolidation that is exactly when you can look to trade again and that is the first sign when seek and short conditions are over this usually happens during NFP CPI or fomc based on the news again that is when price has the volatility to push out of a consolidation to push out of the seek and short conditions now how can we confirm that price is truly out of the second short conditions again the first sign is of course that we are displacing out of the consolidation the second sign is PD arrays are finally following through so discount arrays are finally following through again and that is exactly when we have trending conditions again and then I'll see you at the next A to Z guide episode on Friday where we are going to go over how we can capitalize on Seek and Destroy conditions using Turtle soups but also going over Turtle soups that can be used in trending conditions so a full turtle soup lecture alright now if you want more on low probability conditions and high probability conditions I would highly advise to check out this video and then I'll see you at the next A to Z guide on Friday alright thank you thank you foreign</p>

the most dangerous conditions that you can get trapped in as a trending Trader are Seek and Destroy conditions now the name itself already tells you a lot right Seek and Destroy it's referring to constantly seeking liquidity taking people out of the market both sides of the market are getting taken out short Traders and a long Traders are both getting taken out in this episode I exactly want to go over how we can spot those conditions beforehand and then in the next episode I exactly want to go over Turtle soups and I want to go over how we can potentially capitalize on these conditions because as a Trader I believe you excel in either secant historic conditions or trending conditions it's not a one fits all type thing here we are on Australian dollar US dollar to show you my receipt that it actually is possible to spot Seek and Destroy conditions beforehand in the weekly forecast a heading into this condition the seek any short conditions this consolidation that you're seeing

## <p>I am going to be telling you all the secrets to Market structure in this episode I will go over things about Mark circuit that I have not touched on before on my YouTube in a previous episode inside the A2Z guide we also went over marked structure so I think the basis the bird's eye view of Market structure the way I view it is pretty clear but now I want to Define it even more because again if you understand this this is literally all you need first I wanted to go over NASDAQ and afterwards we are going to go over a Forex pair as well please please on this episode it is crucial to listen to everything I say and to take notes now let's start off with how do we View Market structure again so let's remind ourselves of the basics again we only look at intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows and short-term highs and short-term lows the way I view an intermediate term high and this is the only way I view it nothing else I don't look at is rebalancing a fair value Gap is doing this no the only way I view an intermediate term high is when we have a high that is in the middle and is in between a short-term height that is lower to the left of it and lower to the right of it so this for example right there is an intermediate term High the same for intermediate term low an intermediate term low is when we have a load that is in the middle it is in the middle of a short-term load that is higher to the right of it and a short-term load that is higher to the left of it so this right there is an intermediate term low and they are The Outsiders intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows are always Outsiders what I mean by that is that this for example right there this is also a short-term low this is a short-term low which makes this as well an intermediate term low but if this intermediate term low has an intermediate term low just below it very close to it like this one then you would take this one not this one it's the same with the intermediate term High when this if we look at it from an objective standpoint yes this could be an intermediate term high but this is your real intermediate term high and if we want to look at it from an objective standpoint that is exactly what we're going to go over because if we combine the time frames then this is not an intermediate term high but that is something we will go over in a few moments first we need to talk about the short-term highs and short-term lows now so this is an intermediate term high this is an intermediate term low listen very carefully in between moving from this intermediate term ahai to that intermediate term low short term highs will form no intermediate term high will form in that period so when we move from that intermediate term High to that intermediate term low in between this price action there is no intermediate term High every High that's there is a short term high and if short-term high is defined by having of course a swing high so that right there let me zoom in a little bit that right there is a short-term high this right there is a short-term high now this could that be an intermediate term high no it is not why isn't it an intermediate term High an intermediate term Hive forms after we take an intermediate term low so once we take this intermediate term low right there which is the target when moving from the intermediate term High to the intermediate term low if we then get a bigger retracement this intermediate term high is the one that is protected and now we can expect potentially if it does want to have a bigger retracement then it will likely respect that high with respect it means that yes it can take the high but it's respecting the high still this is your last line of defense if we disrespect that so aka the fair value Gap video that we went over if we close above it if the bullish firefighter gaps are getting respected right there then that is a sign that we are disrespecting that high that is not supposed to happen so once we do take that intermediate term low and we have a big retracement we know all right it shouldn't take that high right there but that high in the middle is not an intermediate term high so the thing I'm trying to tell you here is that only once we take the intermediate term low right there only then a new intermediate term height can form once we have a bigger retracement so again in between from moving from that intermediate to my to that intermediate terminal short-term highs will form now a short-term high is not just a swing High let me first go over one thing when we have an intermediate term I for example this one to now your intermediate term load your new intermediate term low is that low right so we have this intermediate term High to that intermediate term low this area right there that is your intermediate term range aka the range that should not fill so in between that range is where you can potentially if you want to you can draw your premium and discount on then in between this intermediate term high and that intermediate term low we now are forming you guessed it from a short-term High to a short-term low we are forming short term ranges and a short-term range always needs to have a fair value Gap in the range so from That Swing high right there to that swing low do we have a fair value Gap in that range lower yes we have so that is a short-term range AKA this high should get respected and should not get disrespected until we reach that intermediate term low we have at the bottom right there then after that we also have this short term range right there that short term high so once we have that fair value Gap in the lag we have a confirmed short term High a confirmed short-term range as well and the Beautiful Thing is a short-term High usually forms at a previous premium array so this short term High forms at what fair value Gap then this gets swept is it disrespecting that high no it's not it's respecting that high because it's sweeping it's not closing above it it's respecting it so it's sweeping that high so this high is it coming off of a premium rate yes it is does have a perfect up lowering lack on this time frame on one hour it doesn't don't justify the fair value gaps by going down in time frames when you need to justify something you go up in time frames never down in time frames because otherwise everything can be justified then after that what do we we see we have this short-term High because it now has a fair vague of lore so this high should not get disrespected before when before we reach that intermediate term low then afterwards all these Highs are they relevant yes as liquidity they could be relevant but the only thing relevant is that we are not disrespecting that high with our Gap in the leg lower and then right here what do we see we have this height that is leaving behind a new fair value Gap that already only that single fair value Gap that is already enough to tell you this is a new short-term high and that one should not get broken so this right there is your new short term High then afterwards we have a new short-term high and then we reach the Target right there if you have been following along with the other videos you know that we use a context always from an intermediate term height to an intermediate term low in between that price action that is where you want to get involved now I'm going to give you a lot of Golden Nugget so please write them down the St model is based on trading the potential intermediate term High because all you are doing with an st model is trading the first rare value Gap lower in this case which once that happens is you are trying to catch the swing height that is getting formed right there inside that fair value gap which then confirms the intermediate term high so whenever I say a potential intermediate term highest in the making that is what I mean so the SD entry is the very early entry you don't have to take that one that one is riskier the short term ranges that follow afterwards those are the highest probability trades that you can take imagine in this price action lag done right there if if you were to use the no daily bias strategy that was taught in the previous a to c episode you would have a very profitable time a great time what you're not realizing is that you are trading in fact in the middle of a market maker model because moving from this intermediate term high right there to that intermediate term low that is your context that is your marker maker model the only thing is you don't need to know it's a market maker model you don't need to know it's a power of three you don't need to know it's an AMD cycle you don't need to know it's a smart money reversal these are all Concepts that don't need to be that difficult there's literally no benefits of them being that difficult everything I'm going over here is all the concepts you could name a concept it is in the trading plan the only thing you're doing is you're not paying attention to it there's a major reason why we do that in the first place and that is something we go over inside the money making team inside the mentorship it's not that we don't understand the concept it's that we everyone here understands the concepts at such a deep level that we are able to simplify it because again every concept that you can think of is involved in this trading plan and so we know the context we know where a market maker model will likely form but still a bit vague again we are going to go over Market maker model more in depth in an upcoming video but there's two more things that I want to talk about here so right here on the daily time frame on Australian dollar US dollar what are we seeing in the weekly forecast we mentioned lower prices with this being our draw on liquidity then right here this is not the cleanest price action at the top right there but this is again the same premise we see this High then we see this high this is an official short term high Y because it now has a fair value Gap in the lag lower so this high is your last line of defense so you know based on NASDAQ as well what we just saw is you know where to take a trade and you know where to likely place your stop-loss if you can combine the time frames correctly which is what we're going to go over right now then we have a retracement and right here what do we see a new short-term High because it is a new fair value cup lower this high should not get disrespected so we first had that high afterwards that high and now we have this high right there afterwards we see another high another swing high right there is that a short term high no why not it doesn't have a fair value Gap lower so this is your new short term high right there because we have a fair value Gap sitting right there if we Mark out that verify Gap right there and we go into the lower time frame what we saw on the daily time frame were what it were short-term highs and short-term ranges what are we seeing on the one hour time frame intermediate term highs and intermediate term ranges so it's important to understand that once we take out this intermediate term low right there on a one hour basis that the retracement back into that range will 9 out of 10 times will retrace back into a PD array that is on the time frame above it so remember when I tell you the time frame you are trading on needs to be in context of the time frame above it this is what I'm trying to tell you because if you don't see that and you see this fair value got lower on a one hour time frame right there you're getting blindsided by the fact that there's a daily fair value Gap hovering just above your head it's not a fancy Turtle suit concept it's just logic so the intermediate term high that forms on the one hour will form at a premium array on the time frames above it then the same context that we have on the daily time frame where we move from daily premium array to that daily discount array is the same thing that we are seeing on the one hour the only thing is you have the daily provider right there then you have your intermediate term High to your intermediate term low right there and in between that intermediate term high and that intermediate term low that is where your short-term highs will form and that is exactly where you want to get in involved and you don't need to use the one hour for a daily survive you can also go lower that's exactly what I showed inside the trading plan then right here what do we see this St right there what are you doing you are trading the potential intermediate term height that is in the making right there the intermediate term High forms at what it forms at a premium array on the time frame above it so the one hour needs to be in context of the four hour the four hour needs to be in context of the daily means one hour also needs to be in context of your daily automatically so if there's a daily survey Gap right there then the one hour intermediate term high will form at your daily fair value Gap then once we trade into debt and we have fair value gaps lower we have an st model right there the SD model is trading the potential intermediate term high this can be done successfully if you know how to combine the time frames the second one is where we now are trade getting lower then this is now confirmed into mediate term High because we have a short-term High to the right of it and it's a short-term High why it's coming off of this premium array right there in the form of that breaker and the fair value Gap and the most important part it has a fair value Gap lower in the range right there so everything after is even higher probability and then you just follow the highs you follow the height keep on following the heist and when we do have a deeper retracement what do we retrace into something on the higher time frame right here we saw that this was a short-term high on the one hour it's not getting respect anymore why it's retracing right now to that order block with that fair value Gap as well and what forms right there your one hour needs to be in context of your four hour what is forming at that four hour premium array a one hour into me immediate term hi and this is your new one hour intermediate term High and the same exact process happens over and over and over here we are back on NASDAQ because what did I just tell you at the beginning of the video this is not an intermediate term High why not because when you look at it from a one-hour perspective it meets the criteria yes it does the first reason is we have a higher intermediate term High very close to it that is not a subjective but if we now zoom out to the four hour time frame what do we see this is just a short term high this is your intermediate term high this is your new intermediate term high it's having the one hour in context of the four hour time frame so whenever we sweep this high and that intermediate to my under one hour don't be surprised because right there on the lower time frame on the one hour on the 15 minute what's forming at that high even more intermediate term highs it's combining the tire frames so all the components we just talked about so you now know the context you know when to trade how you can get to entries as well because you're just using short-term ranges or your entries and you target intermediate term highs or intermediate term lows remember the criteria for a short-term range and now you know that if you can combine the time frames correctly and you are aware of the time frames and I don't mean combining the time frames as in you're using the two hour tire frame you're using the three hour time frame no just the one minute five minutes 15 minutes one hour four hour daily weekly monthly that's it that's all you need and now you know what it means when I say there's a potential into immediate term high in the making right there you can also try to catch that intermediate term high or you can try to catch the short-term ranges afterwards and you know where intermediate term highs form they form at PD Rays on the time frame above it because the time frame you are trading on always needs to be in context of the time frame above it now you would be absolutely mind blown how we are able to use this inside the mentorship and how we have been able to stack up a lot of assets under management in a very small amount of time you can visit either audio.io or you can scan the QR code that is on your screen right now and then I'll see you at the weekly forecast on Sunday perfect thank you thank you foreign</p>

then confirms the intermediate term high so whenever I say a potential intermediate term highest in the making that is what I mean so the SD entry is the very early entry you don't have to take that one that one is riskier the short term ranges that follow afterwards those are the highest probability trades that you can take imagine in this price action lag done right there if if you were to use the no daily bias strategy that was taught in the previous a to c episode you would have a very profitable time a great time what you're not realizing is that you are trading in fact in the middle of a market maker model because moving from this intermediate term high right there to that intermediate term low that is your context that is your marker maker model the only thing is you don't need to know it's a market maker model you don't need to know it's a power of three you don't need to know it's an AMD cycle you don't need to know it's a smart money reversal these are all Concepts that don't need to be that difficult there's literally no benefits of them being that difficult everything I'm going over here is all the concepts you could name a concept it is in the trading plan the only thing you're doing is you're not paying attention to it there's a major reason why we do that in the first place and that is something we go over inside the money making team inside the mentorship it's not that we don't understand the concept it's that we everyone here understands the concepts at such a deep level that we are able to simplify it because again every concept that you can think of is involved in this trading plan and so we know the context we know where a market maker model will likely form but still a bit vague again we are going to go over Market maker model more in depth in an upcoming video but there's two more things that I want to talk about here so right here on the daily time frame on Australian dollar US dollar what are we seeing in the weekly forecast we mentioned lower prices with this being our draw on liquidity then right here this is not the cleanest price action at the top right there but this is again the same premise we see this High then we see this high this is an official short term high Y because it now has a fair value Gap in the lag lower so this high is your last line of defense so you know based on NASDAQ as well what we just saw is you know where to take a trade and you know where to likely place your stop-loss if you can combine the time frames correctly which is what we're going to go over right now then we have a retracement and right here what do we see a new short-term High because it is a new fair value cup lower this high should not get disrespected so we first had that high afterwards that high and now we have this high right there afterwards we see another high another swing high right there is that a short term high no why not it doesn't have a fair value Gap lower so this is your new short term high right there because we have a fair value Gap sitting right there if we Mark out that verify Gap right there and we go into the lower time frame what we saw on the daily time frame were what it were short-term highs and short-term ranges what are we seeing on the one hour time frame intermediate term highs and intermediate term ranges so it's important to understand that once we take out this intermediate term low right there on a one hour basis that the retracement back into that range will 9 out of 10 times will retrace back into a PD array that is on the time frame above it so remember when I tell you the time frame you are trading on needs to be in context of the time frame above it this is what I'm trying to tell you because if you don't see that and you see this fair value got lower on a one hour time frame right there you're getting blindsided by the fact that there's a daily fair value Gap hovering just above your head it's not a fancy Turtle suit concept it's just logic so the intermediate term high that forms on the one hour will form at a premium array on the time frames above it then the same context that we have on the daily time frame where we move from daily premium array to that daily discount array is the same thing that we are seeing on the one hour the only thing is you have the daily provider right there then you have your intermediate term High to your intermediate term low right there and in between that intermediate term high and that intermediate term low that is where your short-term highs will form and that is exactly where you want to get in involved and you don't need to use the one hour for a daily survive you can also go lower that's exactly what I showed inside the trading plan then right here what do we see this St right there what are you doing you are trading the potential intermediate term height that is in the making right there the intermediate term High forms at what it forms at a premium array on the time frame above it so the one hour needs to be in context of the four hour the four hour needs to be in context of the daily means one hour also needs to be in context of your daily automatically so if there's a daily survey Gap right there then the one hour intermediate term high will form at your daily fair value Gap then once we trade into debt and we have fair value gaps lower we have an st model right there the SD model is trading the potential intermediate term high this can be done successfully if you know how to combine the time frames the second one is where we now are trade getting lower then this is now confirmed into mediate term High because we have a short-term High to the right of it and it's a short-term High why it's coming off of this premium array right there in the form of that breaker and the fair value Gap and the most important part it has a fair value Gap lower in the range right there so everything after is even higher probability and then you just follow the highs you follow the height keep on following the heist and when we do have a deeper retracement what do we retrace into something on the higher time frame right here we saw that this was a short-term high on the one hour it's not getting respect anymore why it's retracing right now to that order block with that fair value Gap as well and what forms right there your one hour needs to be in context of your four hour what is forming at that four hour premium array a one hour into me immediate term hi and this is your new one hour intermediate term High and the same exact process happens over and over and over here we are back on NASDAQ because what did I just tell you at the beginning of the video this is not an intermediate term High why not because when you look at it from a one-hour perspective it meets the criteria yes it does the first reason is we have a higher intermediate term High very close to it that is not a subjective but if we now zoom out to the four hour time frame what do we see this is just a short term high this is your intermediate term high this is your new intermediate term high it's having the one hour in context of the four hour time frame so whenever we sweep this high and that intermediate to my under one hour don't be surprised because right there on the lower time frame on the one hour on the 15 minute what's forming at that high even more intermediate term highs it's combining the tire frames so all the components we just talked about so you now know the context you know when to trade how you can get to entries as well because you're just using short-term ranges or your entries and you target intermediate term highs or intermediate term lows remember the criteria for a short-term range and now you know that if you can combine the time frames correctly and you are aware of the time frames and I don't mean combining the time frames as in you're using the two hour tire frame you're using the three hour time frame no just the one minute five minutes 15 minutes one hour four hour daily weekly monthly that's it that's all you need and now you know what it means when I say there's a potential into immediate term high in the making right there you can also try to catch that intermediate term high or you can try to catch the short-term ranges afterwards and you know where intermediate term highs form they form at PD Rays on the time frame above it because the time frame you are trading on always needs to be in context of the time frame above it now you would be absolutely mind blown how we are able to use this inside the mentorship and how we have been able to stack up a lot of assets under management in a very small amount of time you can visit either audio.io or you can scan the QR code that is on your screen right now and then I'll see you at the weekly forecast on Sunday perfect thank you thank you foreign

## <p>all right so today I wanted to touch on smt smt stands for smart money technique a very powerful two and a very powerful indicator you could call it but there are a few specifics that we need to stick to and that we need to know before we can actually use this indicator now as well an important announcement masterclass enrollments are opening up again on the 17th of June masterclass is truly a beautiful step-by-step guide on putting all the concepts together and getting to a profitable consistent trading plan that fits your personality because that is very important and inside the master class you will also have access to my Discord where you can ask me questions and connect with like-minded Traders as well as you will eventually have the chance if you are ready for it to get linked with a capital provider that way you will have easier access to Capital to trade with and again if you want to be a part of this exclusive community then be aware of the fact that we work with a waiting list once the waiting list is full enrollments will close and just a reminder enrollments are not opening up again in July so be there first link in the description alright so smt smart money technique now smart money technique I think some of you may already know what it is others of you don't know what it is and a lot of people think they know what it is now the first thing we need to understand is that for smt you need to find or you need to have an instrument that you are trading and you need to find another instrument that is closely correlated to the instrument that you are trading so in this case we are trading the E mini SMP the e-mini SMP Futures Contract which other instruments are closely correlated to the es think of NASDAQ the NASDAQ futures contract NQ or ym the Dao fuses contract now for Forex it would look something like maybe Euro US dollar and then you pair it with GBP US dollar Forex is something we will get into as well don't worry so right here we have a four-hour fair value gap on e-mini SMP now if we dive into that for our fair value Gap now we can obviously already see in hindsight that it is moving higher now when we are coming into that for our profile Gap again things on the left right here are not that relevant only when we are looking at smt then the left becomes relevant because if we now take a look and click on a plus sign right there and we click on nqm the same exact Futures Contract just for the NASDAQ new price skill I like to double click on the line then go to line and change it to candles this way what this allows me to do is compare the swing lows so since es and NASDAQ should move perfectly in sync since they are so closely correlated sometimes you will see that they are not moving in sync so sometimes you will see either es or NASDAQ make a lower low moving lower than the NASDAQ does and that is exactly what we want to scout for so if we take a look right here and we Zoom a little bit in on this yard and on this yard and right here we are coming into the for our profile Gap and that right there that is when we want to scout for now smt if we are looking for bullish smt then we are comparing swing lows so right here what do we see we have a swing low made right here on ES we have a swing low on NASDAQ right there a very small swing low right there to the right of that is what another swing low this swing low is lower than that swing low so this is a lower low right here but if we take a look at es we had a swing low right here and this swing low is higher than the swing low to the left of it that is smt there is a crack in correlation they should move in sync and right here they are not moving in sync when that happens there's something underlying there's something behind the scenes there are orders being placed in the Market at that moment in time so right here we draw a line and we draw a line right there that is smt now it could have very well been the other way around right at es made a lower low and that NASDAQ made a higher low that is completely fine as long as they are not moving in sync the swing lows are not lining up perfectly they are not the same that is exactly what we want to see but if you're using smt for a bias too then you are using it the wrong way you will absolutely confuse the living out of yourself if you're using this as a bias tool smt is useful when it is one of your last indicators as in you've already come to your bias you already have a PD array that you now want to trade off you are now looking for confirmation and inside that confirmation there's smt that is perfect that is where we want to see smt when we are confirming some form of PD Ray that is where we want to see smt so if we look a bit further what do we see right here swing low the same swing low is right there on NASDAQ then what do we see here we have swing lows we have another swing low then we have another swing low right there this swing low again is lower than this swing low and this swing low on ES is again higher than this swing low what do we have again smt so again that is our Confluence that is a very strong Confluence that price might want to move higher and again because we already had the context we already had the higher time frame bullish bias then we want to compare the swing lows not the swing highs we are not looking at bearish smt we only focus and Scout for bullish smt here that is crucial to understand now another question is which instrument do you actually trade right here obviously if you are an es Trader or you normally trade NASDAQ then execute on Dapper perfect fine if you are a full-time es Trader and that is your pair that is your bread and butter then just execute on ES whether it makes a lower low or a higher low doesn't matter if you are more of a hybrid style so you want to choose one in the coming videos we will touch on which pair you would want to trade just based off of smt alone is not enough to look at which pair you want to execute on you want to find the strength leader on a higher time frame basis and that is the one you want to trade so in this case you would ask yourself which instrument has been moving a higher more easily over the past few weeks past few days Etc in this case if you take a look at the chart on your own it was NASDAQ so if we were to execute on NASDAQ instead of es right here then we can see the entries I can already tell right here the entries are a bit more difficult but how can we now enter off of this how can we enter when we do c smt I think the es entries when you take the last episode as example it is already pretty self-explanatory right we can all see the entries right here and right here that is what we went over on the last episode but right here this is known as as a turtle soup so when we see smt do we just place an order below that low and now place our stop loss right there and then torque the highs we could do that but at that moment in time we don't know for sure if it is smt so the best technique to enter is called buying on strength technique so what you would do here is the candle that is responsible for a sweep below that low which is this red candle right there that is the one responsible for coming below that low and in that moment if NASDAQ does want to move higher and come above this candles are high right there the candle that was responsible for coming back below that low that exactly there would be your entry now of course your stop-loss give it some room give it some room to breathe don't suffocate your stop loss and that is exactly exactly how you could capitalize on smt and how you could capitalize on a turtle soup in that case so right here if we are NASDAQ Traders as a standard and we wanted to execute on NASDAQ because it's also the stronger pair based off of the higher time frame then this is a technique that we could use to enter on NASDAQ so if we take a look at the other smt that we already had right here this one then what would we do we would do the exact same thing so this right here this candle is responsible for sweeping that low so place a buy stop above that candles are high now where do you place your stop loss right here no give it some room to breathe don't suffocate your stop loss so in this case what you could do is say all right give it six points give it six points so right there we have a six point stop loss perfectly fine keep in mind that this is basically calling the bottom right so once you wait and you allow yourself to have some sort of patience then the better entries will come because you can refine your stop loss better these turtle soup entries Etc are not always the best entries because you need to take into account your stop loss that you were basically calling a top or a bottom but if you do like this and this is exactly how you could capitalize on it so let's dive into an example on Forex pairs as well alright so here we are on GBP USD AKA cable or gu what do we see here based off of the daily well we have this daily fair value Gap sitting right there overlapping with what right here an order block this is our last line of defense this could be our Target so right here we are again looking for some sort of confirmation of that daily fair value Gap let's see if we can get some form of smt which other pair would we use for smt in this case what I would go with is EU so Euro US dollar you can also use the dollar itself especially if you're trading Euro US dollar you can use the dollar but what I like to do is just use Euro US dollar and Great British pound US dollar makes it a little bit easier but again if you prefer just to use the dollar aka the dxy then that is perfectly fine I'm just showing you what's possible here and again if you don't want to use smt that is also very important to understand if you don't want to use smt then just don't use it you are not forced to use smt in this A to Z guide I'm showing you options and that is what we talked about in the intro as well I'm showing you optional things to get to a trading plan to get to an entry pattern Etc and if you don't want to use certain Concepts that I'm teaching here that is perfectly fine do whatever you are comfortable with do whatever feels good for you alright right here we are looking at gu so I'm going to take Euro US dollar as my other pair so new price kill right here I double click on it and then I go to the candles you can as well you can use the line but just keep in mind that when you are using the line this takes the bodies of the candles and this doesn't actually take the Wicks which then indicates obviously that we are not actually looking at swing highs and swing lows based off of the line chart again if you want to use the line chart that is perfectly fine but what I do is I use the candles just so I can get a clearer look at what the swing lows and swing Highs are you can probably already tell there is a huge smt right here compare this low right there and this low to this low and that low can we see what is happening here this right here on you is what it is a swing failure this on gu is what it is a breaker pattern just like we saw on NASDAQ and Es just a couple minutes ago yes was making a swing failure pattern and NASDAQ was making a breaker pattern now if we pay a little bit more attention what do we see as well we have this swing low which is that swing low on gu which obviously gets taken out right there so again a breaker pattern and here we have a swing filler it is failing to come below this swing low again smt compare the swing lows right there that is double smt right there beautiful a very strong Confluence a very strong indicator that we might be going higher now you can already tell this wasn't my indicator to get to my bias no this was my indicator to get to my entry and to have another Confluence because we are working with probabilities and when there is smt it is a higher probability that the entry will work out that is important to understand but I already had context of the higher time frame so right here again this is something we will get into into the next videos as well which pair would you buy the one that is making the swing forward pattern or the one that is making the break better now sometimes you will hear people say you buy the one that is having manipulation so in this case it would be due or you buy the one that is making the swing filter because it is stronger and I somewhat agree with that as well but what I like to stick to is I buy the pair or the instrument that is stronger based off of the higher time frame and that is something we will get into and you can probably tell right now on you that the entry technique that we use on NASDAQ the buying on strength technique is a little bit more difficult here because it just keeps on moving down so you would have your buy stop right here first and then right here no fills just yet and then eventually you get your entry pattern that we talked about in the last episode and that is where you can potentially capitalize on so this is smt again last reminder most gloss enrollments are opening up on the 17th of June we go way more in depth inside the mouse class it is truly the A to Z guide on crack if you want to be a part of that then be fast because they are not opening up again in July so what I want you to do is I want you to study bearish examples I gave you bullish examples now I would love for you to study bearish examples so you compare the swing highs first get to your drawing Equity first get to your buys and then when you're looking for your entry pattern then you compare the swing highs Etc alright perfect I want to thank you and I'll see you at the next video on Friday thank you thank you [Music]</p>

## <p>trading Turtle soups a trading plan using Turtle soups that is exactly what we are going to touch on today so first off we are going to touch on Turtle soups in Seek and Destroy conditions and then afterwards we are going to look at certain techniques that we can use using Turtle soups in trending conditions again just a small disclaimer if you want to use these trading plans that I'm teaching here don't blindly go into trading a live environment or whatever first study the absolute out of these trading models and if you haven't watched the full A to Z guide I would first recommend doing that afterwards slowly implement it on a demo account and from there on if it works for you then slowly start scaling Etc but again that is up to your own decision not Financial advice or anything but don't just blindly start trading these trading plans you need to First study that is very important once you have the ability to spot it in hindsight the then you slowly start forward testing I would not advise back testing unless you do hindsight back testing I would always advise first hindsight back testing and then or testing reason being for that back testing using the replay tool in my opinion always builds up unhealthy habits let's take a look at seek and historic conditions first and how we can trade those so first off we need to determine the range that we are actually stuck in because if you remember the previous episode seek and historic conditions happen at 50 at equilibrium of a certain range once you have determined that exact range what you want to do you want to grab your Fibonacci right there you want to draw it from the range that we are stuck in so you can see we are stuck from that high to that low and you can notice I have an equilibrium level 0.5 but I also have quadrants quadrants indicating that I have 0.75 and 0.25 you can classify the quadrants as the following from zero until 0.25 that is discount discount from 0.25 to equilibrium that is Discount premium from equilibrium until 0.75 that is premium discount from 0.75 until one that is your premium premium the place where you want to look for potential entries is when we are coming off of either a premium premium or a discount discount and you want to be targeting equilibrium again so for example if we zoom in a little bit this area or right there here we are coming into premium premium right there once we reach that premium premium we want to Target equilibrium so in that small area right there that is exactly where we want to get involved a small area again in seek any short conditions you need to understand it's called seek and restore for a reason it's not trending conditions that's exactly why we have different names for different conditions right so you can't expect price to run very far in seek and historical conditions you are not using a very large Target exactly what I'm going to show you in just a few moments so let's dive into the chart having that premium premium on our chart right there so here we are on the five minute time frame now there's a step-by-step process that we need to follow using Turtle soups here on a seek and historic manner so the first thing that we had established was arranged then we use the quadrants then we wait for either premium premium or discount discount in the meantime going into the lower time frame what needs to happen is on the lower time frame so here on the five minute time frame we need to see a Judas a Judas that sweeps liquidity then has an st model so it's a step-by-step range quadrants Judas liquidity sweep SD model entry close Target so we have our range we have our quadrants we have a Judas now does the Judas sweep liquidity if we look to the left yes it does right there we have a nice liquidity pool again how can we Define liquidity it's just swaying highs swing highs right there getting taken out now we want our St model we have first displacement lower right there we want a second one that right there that is exactly what you would want to see enter on an overlapping beat array right there covering the intermediate term high and targeting a closed Target now what do I mean with a closed Target you want to Target a liquidity pull again close to equilibrium of the range that you are trading in so what does that mean right here we had established on a daily time frame the quadrants right this right there is your equilibrium that line right there so if we zoom in again we can see we have liquidity right there beneath equilibrium now there's a few things that you can do here you can either Target equilibrium itself or a fair value Gap that is close to equilibrium or you can Target that liquidity that is sitting right there and what is liquidity it's just a swing low right there that is close to that equilibrium but it's important to understand that in seek and short conditions you are not having a very large Target and what I mean by that is you're not hoping that this absolutely drops to the bottom of the market that's not logical at all we are not in a trending environment price will likely come back to your entry right there so a close easy target a get in get out so this right there was a first entry that we could have taken this is my preferred entry there is another one you can also enter on that first fair value Gap just like we talked about in the St model video itself this is also an entry but again just because you get an early doesn't always mean it's the better entry not at all so the higher probability entry is that second one this can also be your entry but again study the SD model that we talked about and use the time frames correctly then we have a third entry if you miss this first one and you missed the second one or if you want to wait for even more confirmation then right there is your third entry but it's important to understand that there are a lot of different entry types right there it's important to understand you need to stick to one of them so either the first one either the second one either the third one but stick to one of them because in the moment when that entry actually comes to you and you don't have a clear and concise entry pattern and you don't have the guidelines for your entry pattern then those emotions will start to rise and you will enter based on emotions not on having guidelines that is backed up by data that is very important to understand you need to have one entry pattern that you can stick to every single day so if you enter right here and let's say you put your stop loss right there then again what is close to equilibrium you can either Target equilibrium itself or the liquidity right there and that would be your target again easy target getting get out it's not a trending condition so keep that in mind now what do we do after again we start all over again the trading model repeats itself again we determine the range well the range hasn't changed just yet we go over the quadrants again we can see we don't come back to New quadrants but we don't reach discount discount we don't reach premium premium anymore so right here you don't get involved unless there's a new range to work with so let's take a look at that because if we go back into the five minute time frame what can we see we just traded this range right there and then we come back up and then we go back down again and then we fill to follow through on the lows and right here we come back up again indicating that we have a new type of range because we are not following through anymore so we draw our quadrants on the new range right there and we go over the same exact process we have a range established quadrants established Judas liquidity sweep entry close Target so let's look at the quadrant again at this moment in time right here and right here you're not sure if this is a new Range because you're not sure if it's following through but once this field to follow through and fills out to take these lows then you can confidently say that this is failing to follow through it failed to follow through on the highs it's failed to follow through on the lows so if we again look at the quadrants right here and we draw the premium premium right there and we also draw discount discount discount right there now again let's follow the exact step of Judas where's the Judas this is your London session all right nice here we have London coming into it no displacement lower yet so there's nothing to work with just yet here we have an early s stay right there a very early SD would you cover this high right there no you would cover you would not suffocate your stop loss that is very important don't suffocate your stop loss give it some room to breathe right there your potential stop loss what is your target an easy target close to equilibrium where was equilibrium again let's mark it out right there debt right there is your equilibrium all right then we have a swing low right there a swing low right there we have some Eco lows sitting right there so that is already a nice Target there is a one to two and Seek and Destroy conditions perfectly fine you don't need more in seek and historic conditions we have a couple of entries afterwards as well we have that or lock right there targeting what again the same right there now it is logic cover that intermediate term High targeting the exact same I wanted to again perfectly fine afterwards we reach that Target and we head into what discount discount discount right there once we are in discount discount we can again same process Judas liquidity sweep entry close Target right here we have our Judas and we have our liquidity sweep right there for the shorts the liquidity sweep was right there Above That Swing high and on the lows your liquidity sweep is right there so we are in discount discount right there now let's look at an entry so a Judas again right here your PM session starts then we have one St right there bullish for fire gap here bullish flag up as well that is an entry right there targeting what close equilibrium any swing height that could already be your turret and afterwards this could have also been your entry covering the same low targeting equilibrium swing High close to equilibrium perfect now that is a loss so there is two potential loss that we could have taken and if we follow price action afterwards what happens again again later on in the PM session we have again a liquidity sweep right there then we have St already here a small bullish for that could already be your entry covering your stop loss again don't suffocate it give it some room to breathe targeting what a swing High close to equilibrium this swing high is already a one to two a one to two and seek and historical conditions be very content with that because that is more than enough in secret historical conditions afterwards we also have this entry right there based on that order block with the fair value Gap overlapping covering that that low right there this is also almost I want to do a 1.75 in seek and historic conditions and that late in the day where you have at last hour that hour hour a 1.75 be content with that that is nothing to be ashamed of that is actually a great great result if you can achieve that consistently and seek in historic conditions so remember what we went over range quadrants Judith liquidity sweep entry close Target once we reach equilibrium everything is invalidated and you don't look for a new entry until we reach a new quadrant either premium premium or discount discount all right now let's take a look at how we can use Turtle soups in trending conditions here we are on EU on a four hour time frame now we came into a daily fair value Gap right there then we had a lower price and eventually we had a bearish far back up to work with right there on 4 hour and this order block to work with once we had that order block if we now go into the one hour time frame and we look at a rejection right there off of that order block expecting lower prices what we can do here is enter on a one hour fair value Gap now I can already hear you think how is that a turtle soup because if we use this one hour fair value Gap right there and if we then go into the lower Tire frame and use time to our advantage because time is important why is time important again it's a very vague concept A lot of people say time is important time is important because time will exactly tell you in which PD rate price wants to sting into before we head lower so what do I mean by that if we now go into the lower time frame into the five minutes right here we start London and London stings into that one hour for Vegas and continues lower so the reason time is important right there because time will tell you into which PD rate it wants to stay into and from there it will continue lower when London Killzone open right there we first had to move down and afterwards we had a one hour fair value Gap hovering right there so if London now has a retracement higher we go and look and see what it wants to potentially sting into to which premium array it wants to sting into before heading lower with the already established context that we had which leads us to a turtle soup entry right there now why is that a turtle soup entry and why wouldn't you expect that height to hold because we have a one hour fair value Gap right there remember the saying every time frame needs to be in context of the time frame above it five minute needs to be in contact with a 50 minute 15 minute needs to be in contact with the one hour obviously then a five minute needs to already be in context to one hour if there's a one hour fair value Gap right there you can't expect that height to hold it can happen but the probabilities of it happening are very slim so a five minute swing High inside a one hour per hour gap or close to it that is your entry and this is fractal right you can also use a 15 minute fair value Gap with a one minute swing High inside of it where do you place your stop loss on a 5 minute base you place your stop loss above the intermediate term High what is the intermediate term high right here the clear concise intermediate term high right here is that I right there what do you target well you're Target was already established on a four hour basis remember what we talked about in the earlier A to Z guide videos from premium to a discount array your premium rate that you're essentially trading off of is that for our order block the discount rate that you're targeting then is a swing low on a four hour basis which is an intermediate term low on a five minute base so that exactly that is your target with a beautiful entry right there now it's important to understand the the context behind what I'm doing here because you can notice that the one hour fair value Gap right there the one hour forever Gap that's sitting right there that trade is taken before we take that draw on liquidity so inside that range from premium to discount rate inside that range is when I take the trade that is very important to understand now this was one of the techniques but you also have a technique selling on weakness and buying on strength here we are back on ES again and what we can see right here already is we have a turtle soup right there that we could have potentially entered on now of course in hindsight beautiful but what are the steps to achieving that the first thing is context what is the context here you have again it's your Judas it's your liquidity sweep it's your entry it's the same as those seeking historic conditions but you don't use a range you don't use quadrants right there the context is as well we have no perfect gaps higher in this lag up whenever there's no fair value gets higher in that lag up the odds of getting swept are already increased now it could have also gotten swapped if there were prevalent gaps in that leg and time will tell you that again what we went over time is important in that because time will tell you does it want to sweep that does it not want to sweep that doesn't want to respect the low and the reason I say that is because your entry opportunity doesn't present if time doesn't tell you anything and let me show you why right there so we go from time so at 8 30 if we go into the 5 minute time frame here we are on a five minute time frame now this is the buying on strength technique one thing you can obviously do is just place a buy limit below that low but what you need to understand if you're seeing someone on Instagram on Twitter on YouTube doing this then just know their stop loss isn't like that they don't have a they don't have a tight stop loss their stop-loss has room to breathe so yes you can enter on this but you need to give your stop-loss room to breathe so on Forex it's like a 20 30 pip stop loss on ES right here I would argue all right maybe an 8 to 10 pip stop loss so you don't suffocate that stop loss that is very important to understand and that is why I say and that is why I mentioned a lot of times Turtle soups are nice to trade and they look very fancy and you can get to a bottom right there and they feel very great your ego gets satisfied Etc but in my opinion they are not the highest probability they are not the best entries they don't give you the best RR in my opinion if you just wait there are better entries out there so right there this is one of the techniques that you could use just purely based of the Judas and liquidity sweep that time time will tell you into which discount array it wants to trade A2 again right here again if we use time we can use the buying on strength technique buying on strength technique you want to enter above the candle that was responsible for sweeping that low so what I mean by that you have this load that we were talking about then you have this down candle that was responsible because this is the one that came below that low that was sweeping the low buying on strength you place a buy stop above that candles high right there you would have gotten tagged in right there you place your stop loss below that load that potential intermediate term low right there and afterwards you target the exact premium rate that we had in mind already going into the one hour discount to premium array and the reason I say time is important and time will tell you exactly what I want to do is because let me clarify it one more time no pun intended right here 8 30 had this due to swing lower there was no entry opportunity beforehand if you use time and the Judas and the liquidity suit there was no entry even before that that is why time is important and time just thinks into that discount array into that liquidity sweep right there and then you place your buy stop right there buying on strength and then you're in and you target those exact highs now of course you guessed it on EU that we just showed you can also use the exact same methods that we went over here where you first enter on the anticipated liquidity sweep and then you use the buying on strength technique but on EU of course it was a short so you would use the selling on the weakness technique which is the exact same only of course in first it's important to understand when sick and historic conditions happen both portrays that are trying to trade second destroy conditions and Traders that are trying to avoid seeking short conditions so if you haven't watched that video just yet then write right here on the screen you can go to that video and I will tell you exactly how to spot seeking short conditions alright perfect thank you foreign</p>

lower there was no entry opportunity beforehand if you use time and the Judas and the liquidity suit there was no entry even before that that is why time is important and time just thinks into that discount array into that liquidity sweep right there and then you place your buy stop right there buying on strength and then you're in and you target those exact highs now of course you guessed it on EU that we just showed you can also use the exact same methods that we went over here where you first enter on the anticipated liquidity sweep and then you use the buying on strength technique but on EU of course it was a short so you would use the selling on the weakness technique which is the exact same only of course in first it's important to understand when sick and historic conditions happen both portrays that are trying to trade second destroy conditions and Traders that are trying to avoid seeking short conditions so if you haven't watched that video just yet then write right here on the screen you can go to that video and I will tell you exactly how to spot seeking short conditions alright perfect thank you foreign

## <p>all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right so today I wanted to touch on internal and external now this is something we have already touched on but now we are going to actually give it a name so let's not waste any time and let's actually dive into the chart straight away all right so what do we have here we have a fourth line of defense that is your first line of defense right on the daily then we have a last line of defense would be all the way down here now we are in very high momentum so what is the first raw liquidity in high momentum staying into fervai Gap then continued higher this is actually your first premium race so this would be your first Target and the second target would be that one so if we now dive into the 15 minute what do we actually see we are coming into that daily fair value Gap right there all right that is where we have the sting now I'm scouting for an external move to an internal move now what does that mean external move what is external if we are expecting a higher price all the swing lows right should hold somewhat they should likely see some respect so when we are still moving lower this is an external move so every move below a swing low or an intermediate term low is an external move so right here this is an external move now once we break Above That Swing high right there then we get an internal move and an internal move is when we have Bear Valley gaps or the blocks that are being respected an external move is a sweep of liquidity so it is a turtle soup so this right here is a turtle soup it is an external move then once we break this low and now break that high so that is the first swing High when we break that swing high with that little Wick right there we don't have to close above it necessarily that is your Market structure shift so we now have an external move first and then we move above That Swing high that is your Market structure now the most important thing as to how we can know if it will be an external or internal move is if there is some sort of fair value Gap in the lag so right here in this lag up we don't have a verify Gap up just yet so what do we see we see a sweep of these lows then afterwards we do get fair value gaps so when we have fair value gaps up in the lag they are more likely to hold and more likely to have an internal move than an external move after we take more highs we have a bigger retracement right here now this can be seen as a bigger internal move but also it is somewhat of an external move and this is what you'll see a lot of times when we are moving higher you sometimes get some sort of sweep in the middle of the leg up and then move higher again that is your external to now internal because now we are respecting the breaker that was created right there and then we can continue higher and what do we also have in this leg a clear fair value Gap so that is external to internal let's go over a bearish example as well alright here we are on yes I mean SMP now let's take a look at this example so we swept a high right here then we had a fair value Gap lower leaving behind that fair value Gap with that order block so if we dive into the five minute right here what do we actually see well we are coming into that order block then afterwards we get this external move and now we drop lower we already have a marked structure shift why is this one not holding I'm not going to go into time just yet so some of you may already notice it is only the beginning of London we are going to go into the kill zones later on but if we look at it from a technical standpoint right here yes we had an external we didn't have an internal just yet so if you want more confirmation then you wait for an internal so a lot of times people will get tricked out by the external first for example there and then you get the real external and the real internal that is what happens a lot of time now how can we prevent this is by first waiting for the external and then waiting for the internal as well and then after an internal you potentially get a new internal and that is where you enter so and right here if we take a look at this we have an external then what do we see here we have an internal but this is also an external of this one then we have a new internal and right there could be your entry right there and you can see how we are moving from external to internal and here you could even say a new external to a new internal so if this is your new external you have a new internal then here you have a new internal an internal can be followed by a new internal again what makes this an external it's because we are sweeping those highs and we are expecting lower prices that is the main difference right we are expecting lower prices so the swing highs should somewhat hold when they don't and they get swept every time price trades above a swing High it is now at a premium array and Above That Swing High when we move back below it again that is where we can short then we have an external to now an internal move and an internal move is mostly confirmed when we have a verify Gap in the lag right there when we have a fair value Gap in the leg the high is a less less likely to get swept again that's probabilities that is not something set in stone but it is less likely to get swept because you need to understand prices either rebalancing or taking liquidity so if it's not rebalancing something then it's what staking liquidity then we could wait for more confirmation so once we move back up here we have an internal move but we could wait for more info confirmation we have a new fair value Gap lower we could enter right there if we feel like it and this is fractal right if this was on a higher time frame that we would even look for the same stuff on the lower time frame so if you've noticed and you've actually paid attention to the full A to Z guide then I can already confidently say that you now know how to get to your bias how to get to your drone liquidity how to enter which PD race to use where to target where to place your stop loss it's stuff we've all went over but a lot of stuff went over your head if you didn't pay attention but again we will dive deeper and deeper into it we are not finished yet alright then this is it for external internal and then I will see you on Friday alright perfect study and take care thank you foreign [Music]</p>

## <p>all right welcome back so today I wanted to touch on daily profiles again and the kill zones that we are going to be using in indices so previous episode was about 4X kill zones now we are going to be touching on Kale zones or the Innes so I'm mainly going to be touching on NASDAQ es and ym that is NASDAQ of course that is enqueue the Futures Contract then we have es which is the future contract for the e-mini S P 500 and then we have ym which is the Dao or us-30 so first let's get the times right Asia and London are the exact same as in Forex but today I mainly want to go over London New York am session and then New York PM session so London is the same from 2 till 5 a.m New York eastern time always New York local time then we have New York am session New York am session starts at 8 30 a.m and ends at 11 am in your New York am session you have equities open at 9 30 a.m from 9 30 a.m until 10 30 am you have opening range and then at 1 30 PM until 4 pm you have New York p.m session then from 3 to 4 pm that is called the closing hour every single one of these sessions every single thing that I just mentioned that certain characteristics and that is exactly what we are going to go over remember that these certain characteristics are all probabilities and that they are all a general rule of thumb we still have to react to what the market is giving us and from there we have something to work with so let's dive into it first of course what are we aiming for right here we just saw a huge move up right there right there I see an order block now the reason right here why I'm not including this wig and I'm ignoring it is usually when there's a huge Wick right there it is mainly because of news and I tend to ignore it completely so then I would just take this order block and ignoring the wick right there alright if we know we can potentially trade into that order block because we just swept some loads discount array to now a premium array right there if we drop into the 15 minute again I'm using the same FX Market sessions right there for my indicator the first thing you will notice right here is probably that the am session and the PM session are very volatile so so indices are mainly very volatile in New York and not as volatile in London if you want to trade some kind of indices during London I would advise to trade ducks that is what I trade for a long time I've traded indices for a very long time for my London I would focus on ducks and for New York session I would mainly focus on ES so right here we are on NASDAQ and that's the same exact thing main volatility of this day is in New York so London almost acts as a sort of Asian range that we just saw in Forex kill zones London is generally not something you want to trade when you are trading indices you want to focus on AM and PM sessions so London consolidation am expansion and PM somewhat of an expansion but less of an expansion than am right there coming into that for our portable block that we just saw the general rule of thumb and this repeats every day is consolidation expansion consolidation or expansion consolidation expansion that is indicating if London is a consolidation am usually is an expansion then afterwards PM is usually also a consolidation the same as London so it switches around every time if London is a big expansion and will have an example of that just in a few moments then am is likely some form of consolidation if am is some form of consolidation then PM session is likely an expansion again so we are constantly moving from consolidation expansion consolation expansion consolidation expansion every single time so if we zoom in a bit here we have London consolidation if we dive into the five minute now the thing I want you to understand the difference between Forex and indices indices is a real liquidity Hunter Forex as well of course it is all based around liquidity but if you're looking to trade liquidity pools for example Turtle soups and you would look for a lower time from entry right there indices are the way to go in this is a love taking liquidity and then running that's what you'll see a lot of times so what we see here is a London consolidation am sweep of London then at 9 30 we have equities open right there 9 30 until 10 30 that is your opening range the opening range usually makes the high or low of the day because that is where the most volatility is there's a lot of volatility coming into the market at 9 30 because it is equities open so ideally you want to get involved after Equity is open now the thing is what you'll see sometimes is when 8 30 at 8 30 we are already coming into an higher time from premium or discount array and 8 30 already expands then 9 30 will likely only be a retracement of what 8 30 created it will continue higher or lower that's exactly the same scenario as that we saw on the previous episode with Asia already expanding London being a retracement of that and then continuing right here we have a liquidity sweep we're making the low of the day right there we are expending higher we have some form of retracement right there then again we are expanding higher the middle in between the am session and the PM session what you'll usually see is another liquidity sweep right here another liquidity sweep before we start running again now why is the PM session again an expansion because I just mentioned consolidation expansion consolidation it is because the PM session has not yet reached the target where was the target the target was the four hour order block right there so you'll see PM session is still expanding so in that case if you're still looking for trades right here maybe off of that fair value Gap right there that is a perfectly fine trade still in PM session as long as you keep the Target right there in mind at 40 PM session can you notice where a lot of volatility comes into the market closing hour closing hour or sometimes refer to Power Hour on 3 3pm until 4 pm that is your bonds closing hour right there you have a lot of volatility coming into the market because price needs to get to that objective quick for that day it still is one hour to do something it needs to do it quick right now so that is where also a lot of volatility comes into the market so indices are very great if you want to be a scalper because you have a lot of volatility coming into the market at certain times of the day if you were to trade to one minute for example I would prefer trading the 1M on the indices instead of trading 1m04x because if we drop down into the one minute what did we just see we saw a London sweep right there and right there we have an entry right there and if we look at the PM session the five minutes per Ferry Gap we just saw right there is also an entry both based off of the St model that I'm teaching inside the mentorship so if you truly want to be a scalper i I would advise to trade illnesses instead of Forex so here we are on ES again important to understand NASDAQ es ym have all the same characteristics of course in between and there might be very small characteristics that differ a little bit but overall they have the same characteristics on the kill zones so right here what do we see we see London expanding right there and this is important before 8 30 or around 8 30 right there we took these lows right there that indicates that a low resistance liquidity run has already happened right there in other words we already had a run on liquidity right there before coming into the am session so what you'll see right there is at 9 30 equities open and the opening range will likely be a consolidation some form of consolidation right there the reason being is because London and before 8 30 so before am session started we already achieved the objective the mission was already complete so am session is consolidating right there to generate new liquidity and what you'll generally see is that PM session then BM session will be an expansion and will be more volatile and that is exactly what we got right there how can we explain this in terms of the kill songs we just explained London expansion am consolidation again PM expansion but again like I said in the beginning as well these characteristics are general rule of thumb here how can we in terms of the A to Z guide as well and the structure we apply how can we view this intermediate term low got taken after that intermediate term low got taken at the right session right there this session could have also been a PM session and then I would have expected that PM session to consolidate some type of consolidation a bigger retracement into the intermediate term range premium right there and then we continue lower see how all these concepts are working in harmony the kill zones the structure everything is working in harmony so that intermediate turn low was our objective so once that gets taken before we have the most volatile session normally the am session then that could be a consolidation and then the PM session if this is a consolidation the PM session we know almost for certain it will have more movement than the am session so consistently I am giving you if then if we've reached the objective before a 30 likely consolidation if consolidation then PM session expansion there's constantly an if and then there's constantly an algorithmic Factor there's a mechanical guideline that is exactly why I always call it a step-by-step guide if you're paying attention and taking notes and I know most view are then it's no surprise that you're now seeing it is constantly in every every episode there's an if and then if and then if and then consistently you could make a song of it so on NASDAQ we had consolidation expansion consolidation here on ES we had expansion consolidation expansion now can you notice one last thing that I'm trying to tell here these hours the equities open the closing hour every single thing has certain characteristics as a general rule of thumb but based on liquidity look how fractal this is look how fractal we expect a lot of volatility to come into the market at closing hour right because closing hour you can see it as a take profit closing hour wants to take profit bonds are closing so it wants to take their profit right there the sort of as a London close so what do we see we take this intermediate term low this consolidates then we have a new intermediate term low right there we retrace creating a new protected High potentially if we now take out that new intermediate term row based on a structure video that we went over right here at closing hour where a lot of volatility comes into the market why did this consolidate this before closing hour we already took that intermediate term low right there so now the objective the same as the am session consolidation the objectives already complete you can apply this to every session see how fractal the market here is and can you now see also the am session Consolidated the PM session swept liquidity right there at equilibrium at premium of that range there could be an entry because in the PM session like I just mentioned on NASDAQ as well am session PM session indices in general they want to hunt liquidity first and then they take off so right there on the one minute what do we see we have an exact one minute entry right there and again reminder the reason I'm going into 1M on the indices is because the 1M on indices is way more doable to navigate than on Forex if you want to trade 1M if you want to be a scalper indices are your go-to instruments and that is what I have traded for a very long time so right here if you just apply the flood and a lot Concepts there's a very easy entry right there right you have this entry right there and then you also have that entry right there now let's look at one more example all right here we are on the daily on ES let's dive into this price action on the 15 minute so if we drop down into the 50 minute we were coming off of a daily survey Gap there as well now what do we see here right here we have we have a London consolidation right there and then it is very important to understand once you start trading the indices that at the am session if you want to be an AM session Trader am session first has a fake move and then the real move starts that is what happens a lot of the time so don't get faked by this fake move how would you not get faked by this fake move by understanding the higher time frame we were inside a daily for Vega AKA a discount so price will seek a premium in what form we have an order block right there on the four hour with most importantly this fair value gap on the four hour so if we drop back down into into the 15 minutes right here we see am session creates that low of the day in the opening range continues higher right there sweeping again liquidity a real liquidity Hunter now if you go into the lower time frame yourself right here that would be a great study going to the lower time frame right there and study how you could have gotten involved based off of the flood the lot all the stuff that has been taught to this day this is Thursday 1st of June on the es continuous contract then what do we see am expense and then in between here we already reach that premium array so we have already reached a target for that day so what happens BM session right there somewhat consolidates but the most important to understand it doesn't expand higher right there it consolidates and someone is in between if this was a candle it would have been a doge candle where you just have one small body and you have two long Wicks on both sides it is somewhat of a consolidation and you see a huge move down at the closing hour right there the volatility is there so right here if you do want to look at anything you would rather prefer shorts over Longs because we've already reached that Target that is important to understand so again there is an if then statement if PM session has already reached this and that then do this same for your am session if am session has already done this then that then do this consistently and you can see again consolidation expansion huge expansion consolidation the next day what do we see again London consolidation right there a big down move first and then we expand higher here you can see the difference 8 30 already had a big expansion up so when that happens 9 30 will still get a fake move down but it likely won't take out what 830 already established and then what do we see after PM session consolidation right there consolidation expansion consolidation or what also happens sometimes expansion consolidation expansion and that is also what we've talked about so go study this see how it applies to the market and as well remember if you're a Forex Trader or an industrator both Forex skill zones and innocent skill zones are important because the characteristics of these skill zones and these sessions they are very important to acknowledge and that is how we get the most potential out of you alright perfect thank you thank you

all right welcome back so today I wanted to touch on daily profiles again and the kill zones that we are going to be using in indices so previous episode was about 4X kill zones now we are going to be touching on Kale zones or the Innes so I'm mainly going to be touching on NASDAQ es and ym that is NASDAQ of course that is enqueue the Futures Contract then we have es which is the future contract for the e-mini S P 500 and then we have ym which is the Dao or us-30 so first let's get the times right Asia and London are the exact same as in Forex but today I mainly want to go over London New

then from 3 to 4 pm that is called the closing hour every single one of these sessions every single thing that I just mentioned that certain characteristics and that is exactly what we are going to go over remember that these certain characteristics are all probabilities and that they are all a general rule of thumb we still have to react to what the market is giving us and from there we have something to work with so let's dive into it first of course what are we aiming for right here we just saw a huge move up right there right there I see an order block now the reason right here why I'm not including this wig and I'm ignoring it is usually when there's a huge Wick right there it is mainly because of news and I tend to ignore it completely so then I would just take this order block and ignoring the wick right there alright if we know we can potentially trade into that order block because we just swept some loads discount array to now a premium array right there if we drop into the 15 minute again I'm using the same FX Market sessions right there for my indicator the first thing you will notice right here is probably that the am session and the PM session are very volatile so so indices are mainly very volatile in New York and not as volatile in London if you want to trade some kind of indices during London I would advise to trade ducks that is what I trade for a long time I've traded indices for a very long time for my London I would focus on ducks and for New York session I would mainly focus on ES so right here we are on NASDAQ and that's the same exact thing main volatility of this day is in New York so London almost acts as a sort of Asian range that we just saw in Forex kill zones London is generally not something you want to trade when you are trading indices you want to focus on AM and PM sessions so London consolidation am expansion and PM somewhat of an expansion but less of an expansion than am right there coming into that for our portable block that we just saw the general rule of thumb and this repeats every day is consolidation expansion consolidation or expansion consolidation expansion that is indicating if London is a

that just in a few moments then am is likely some form of consolidation if am is some form of consolidation then PM session is likely an expansion again so we are constantly moving from consolidation expansion consolation expansion consolidation expansion every single time so if we zoom in a bit here we have London consolidation if we dive into the five minute now the thing I want you to understand the difference between Forex and indices indices is a real liquidity Hunter Forex as well of course it is all based around liquidity but if you're looking to trade liquidity pools for example Turtle soups and you would look for a lower time from entry right there indices are the way to go in this is a love taking liquidity and then running that's what you'll see a lot of times so what we see here is a London consolidation am sweep of London then at 9 30 we have equities open right there 9 30 until 10 30 that is your opening range the opening range usually makes the high or low of the day because that is where the most volatility is there's a lot of volatility coming into the market at 9 30 because it is equities open so ideally you want to get involved after Equity is open now the thing is what you'll see sometimes is when 8 30 at 8 30 we are already coming into an higher time from premium or discount array and 8 30 already expands then 9 30 will likely only be a retracement of what 8 30 created it will continue higher or lower that's exactly the same scenario as that we saw on the previous episode with Asia already expanding London being a retracement of that and then continuing right here we have a liquidity sweep we're making the low of the day right there we are expending higher we have some form of retracement right there then again we are expanding higher the middle in between the am session and the PM session what you'll usually see is another liquidity sweep right here another liquidity sweep before we start running again now why is the PM session again an expansion because I just mentioned consolidation expansion consolidation it is because the PM session has not yet reached the target where was the target the target was the four hour order block right there so you'll see PM session is still expanding so in that case if you're still looking for trades right here maybe off of that fair value Gap right there that is a perfectly fine trade still in PM session as long as you keep the Target right there in mind at 40 PM session can you notice where a lot of volatility comes into the market closing hour closing hour or sometimes refer to Power Hour on 3 3pm until 4 pm that is your bonds closing hour right there you have a lot of volatility coming into the market because price needs to get to that objective quick for that day it still is one hour to do something it needs to do it quick right now so that is where also a lot of volatility comes into the market so indices are very great if you want to be a scalper because you have a lot of volatility coming into the market at certain times of the day if you were to trade to one minute for example I would prefer trading the 1M on the indices instead of trading 1m04x because if we drop down into the one minute what did we just see we saw a London sweep right there and right there we have an entry right there and if we look at the PM session the five minutes per Ferry Gap we just saw right there is also an entry both based off of the St model that I'm teaching inside the mentorship so if you truly want to be a scalper i I would advise to trade illnesses instead of Forex so here we are on ES again important to understand NASDAQ es ym have all the same characteristics of course in between and there might be very small characteristics that differ a little bit but overall they have the same characteristics on the kill zones so right here what do we see we see London expanding right there and this is important before 8 30 or around 8 30 right there we took these

before am session started we already achieved the objective the mission was already complete so am session is consolidating right there to generate new liquidity and what you'll generally see is that PM session then BM session will be an expansion and will be more volatile and that is exactly what we got right there how can we explain this in terms of the kill songs we just explained London expansion am consolidation again PM expansion but again like I said in the beginning as well these characteristics are general rule of thumb here how can we in terms of the A to Z guide as well and the structure we apply how can we view this intermediate term low got taken after that intermediate term low got taken at the right session right there this session could have also been a PM session and then I would have expected that PM session to consolidate some type of consolidation a bigger retracement into the intermediate term range premium right there and then we continue lower see how all these concepts are working in harmony the kill zones the structure everything is working in harmony so that intermediate turn low was our objective so once that gets taken before we have the most volatile session normally the am session then that could be a consolidation and then the PM session if this is a consolidation the PM session we know almost for certain it will have more movement than the am session so consistently I am giving you if then if we've reached the objective before a 30 likely consolidation if consolidation then PM session expansion there's constantly an if and then there's constantly an algorithmic Factor there's a mechanical guideline that is exactly why I always call it a step-by-step guide if you're paying attention and taking notes and I know most view are then it's no surprise that you're now seeing it is constantly in every every episode there's an if and then if and then if and then consistently you could make a song of it so on NASDAQ we had consolidation expansion consolidation here on ES we had expansion consolidation expansion now can you notice one last thing that I'm trying to tell here these hours the equities open the closing hour every single thing has certain characteristics as a general rule of thumb but based on liquidity look how fractal this is look how fractal we expect a lot of volatility to come into the market at closing hour right because closing hour you can see it as a take profit closing hour wants to take profit bonds are closing so it wants to take their profit right there the sort of as a London close so what do we see we take this intermediate term low this consolidates then we have a new intermediate term low right there we retrace creating a new protected High potentially if we now take out that new intermediate term row based on a structure video that we went over right here at closing hour where a lot of volatility comes into the market why did this consolidate this before closing hour we already took that intermediate term low right there so now the objective the same as the am session consolidation the objectives already complete you can apply this to every session see how fractal the market here is and can you now see also the am session Consolidated the PM session swept liquidity right there at equilibrium at premium of that range there could be an entry because in the PM session like I just mentioned on NASDAQ as well am session PM session indices in general they want to hunt liquidity first and then they take off so right there on the one minute what do we see we have an exact one minute entry right there and again reminder the reason I'm going into 1M on the indices is because the 1M on indices is way more doable to navigate than on Forex if you want to trade 1M if you want to be a scalper indices are your go-to instruments and that is what I have traded for a very long time so right here if you just apply the flood and a lot Concepts there's a very easy entry right there right you have this entry right there and then you also have that entry right there now let's look at one more example all right here we are on the daily on ES let's dive into this price action on the 15 minute so if we drop down into the 50 minute we were coming off of a daily survey Gap there as well now what do we see here right here we have we have a London consolidation right there and then it is very important to understand once you start trading the indices that at the am session if you want to be an AM session Trader am session first has a fake move and then the real move starts that is what happens a lot of the time so don't get faked by this fake move how would you not get faked by this fake move by understanding the higher time frame we were inside a daily for Vega AKA a discount so price will seek a premium in what form we have an order block right there on the four hour with most importantly this fair value gap on the four hour so if we drop back down into into the 15 minutes right here we see am session creates that low of the day in the opening range continues higher right there sweeping again liquidity a real liquidity Hunter now if you go into the lower time frame yourself right here that would be a great study going to the lower time frame right there and study how you could have gotten involved based off of the flood the lot all the stuff that has been taught to this day this is Thursday 1st of June on the es continuous contract then what do we see am expense and then in between here we already reach that premium array so we have already reached a target for that day so what happens BM session right there somewhat consolidates but the most important to understand it doesn't expand higher right there it consolidates and someone is in between if this was a candle it would have been a doge candle where you just have one small body and you have two long Wicks on both sides it is somewhat of a consolidation and you see a huge move down at the closing hour right there the volatility is there so right here if you do want to look at anything you would rather prefer shorts over Longs because we've already reached that Target that is important to understand so again there is an if then statement if PM session has already reached this and that then do this same for your am session if am session has already done this then that then do this consistently and you can see again consolidation expansion huge expansion consolidation the next day what do we see again London consolidation right there a big down move first and then we expand higher here you can see the difference 8 30 already had a big expansion up so when that happens 9 30 will still get a fake move down but it likely won't take out what 830 already established and then what do we see after PM session consolidation right there consolidation expansion consolidation or what also happens sometimes expansion consolidation expansion and that is also what we've talked about so go study this see how it applies to the market and as well remember if you're a Forex Trader or an industrator both Forex skill zones and innocent skill zones are important because the characteristics of these skill zones and these sessions they are very important to acknowledge and that is how we get the most potential out of you alright perfect thank you thank you

## <p>today we are going to go over on how you can know when and where you should enter in the previous episode we mentioned structure we went over structure very in-depth if we take the same exact example here on NASDAQ and we were talking about that intermediate term high so this intermediate term High to that intermediate term low that is our Target and we briefly touched on the short term ranges because the short-term ranges we were talking about is exactly how you can know where to enter Because essentially all you're doing is you're entering on short-term ranges and you're targeting the intermediate term low if we dive into that even deeper what we can see is if we draw our Fibonacci 2 from the intermediate term High to the Target aka the intermediate term low then these are your swing rates we have zero we have 0.25 0.5 AKA your equilibrium then we have 0.75 and then we have one and one is your Terminus Terminus meaning your target your draw on liquidity the way we use the swing race is very interesting because you always draw it in the right context you draw it from the intermediate term height to the intermediate terminal of course if you're looking to sell you're looking for shorts if you're looking for Longs and you're looking for bullish price action you will draw it from an intermediate term low to an intermediate term high now let me explain the characteristics of each of those levels 0.25 is where you will have a first entry likely some kind of St entry happens around that level at 0.5 is equilibrium which means that at equilibrium price is not in premium and it's not in discount so what you can expect there is you can expect first off a consolidation second of all a liquidity sweep and third of all you can also expect a new entry at that level then the 0.75 level right here that is is where you can expect another entry but that is the area where you would not expect a huge retracement anymore so if we are close to the draw liquidity and we can Define close to the Drone liquidity by having the 0.75 level on our chart then we are close to the Drone quality we would not always expect a huge retracement into an overlapping PD array that is exactly what we talked about in the fair Valley golf video where if we are closer to drone liquidity you would not expect a huge retracement and you could only expect just a sting into a fair value Gap that is usually what happens at the 0.25 level and the 0.75 level at those two levels is where you could see just a sting into a fair value Gap and the 0.75 level is where the Silver Bullet entry happens so with these characteristics that we now know we can get very accurate with our entry and we know what we can expect and that is very important so for example if you always want to trade at the 0.75 or you always want to trade a silver bullet entry then a mechanical step or that would be is you have your intermediate term High you have your intermediate term low AKA your Target that is your context then you have to context the next step is drawn with swing grades you wait for the 0.75 level to be hit and you enter on the first prior value Gap that you can see and that's it Target intermediate term low that is your silver bullet entry that is exactly and for each of those levels you can get a very mechanical guideline but just to show you the fractality of this let's zoom in on this liquidity sweep why is that a liquidity sweep well what are the characteristics again of the 0.5 level once we trade into that 0.5 level right there we can expect some kind of consolidation some kind of liquidity sweep and then we continue lower and we can also expect an entry now let's zoom in on this liquidity sweep right there here we are on the the one minute time frame now if we take the trading plan the time trading plan that we mentioned where you just use the one hour and you have a one minute or five minute entry then right here you would wait for 9 30 open right there it stinks into that high again do we need to know that do we need to know exactly where it comes into from which premium rate it had to lower from yes of course that's helpful but if you use this particular trading plan then time will tell you into which premium rate will stick into because there's no entry opportunity before that the entry opportunity happens after that so you react same exact premise it's just fractal you have the intermediate term height that is being formed right there and you target what that intermediate term low on the one minute right there so what do you do you draw your Fibonacci tool from that intermediate term height to that Target right there which is the intermediate term low on a one minute basis then you can see the first entry the 0.25 level right there once we trade into that again when I say we are trading into that level if we just cross that level so we just trade below it or of course if we're looking for high prices we trade above it if we just cross that line then that's exactly when you can expect some kind of Entry whatever occurs right there that is where you have the first SD entry a very early entry right there again same Target right there again if you're reacting that might be a too early entry for your liking perfectly fine afterwards if we follow structure because what you're doing is you're not just entering base of the Swing rates no no keep in mind the structure that we're using they're right there that swing high is now what a short term High AKA this is your short term range then we reach 0.5 level right once we reach that 0.5 level what can we expect that is where you usually see a bigger retracement than on a 0.25 level and a bigger retracement than you would see on the 0.75 and liquidity sweep and some kind of consolidation here we have above that high some kind of liquidity sweep and you can see it's taking way longer count the candles how many candles are in here compared to your 0.75 level and compared to your 0.25 level way more candles in there at the 0.5 level you can again just like 0.75 level and just like 0.25 level you can make a mechanical trading plan around it because you could say alright I do the exact same we have our contacts we have our premium array we have our contacts from the intermediate term High to the intermediate term low context Next Step swing rates Next Step again short-term range is you use the short term ranges once we reach below the 0.5 level we enter on an overlapping PD array so what would you do you use that low right there overlapping with debt fair value Gap and you enter off of that where does your stop loss go above the short-term High why because based on structure these short-term highs should now hold until when until we reach the target intermediate term low so you already know your stop loss based on structure you already know your target based on structure and you already know your entry based on structure alone you can already get to an entry with the swing raise you can Define it even more more advanced entries for certain levels that we are working with so here entry Target that beautiful but again still that might be a little bit of a too early entry for your liking perfectly fine then what is the next protected High well we already have that I with debt for Vega blower remember what I talked about in the previous structure video If we have that fair value already then that is already your new short-term range so this fair value Gap is already an entry then that right there is already your stop-loss level because you can see this as an SD entry in the middle of the lag in the middle of the lag lower we have another St being created right there and then again same Target that intermediate term low and then what happens we have this new high and then what do we see now we reach the 0.75 level now you can see I ignored the 0.75 level because we first had that 0.5 level and we didn't have any consolidation yet we didn't have a liquidity sweep yet so in that case I ignore that we reached the 0.75 level and I wait for something to set up here and then once we reach the 0.75 level again then it gets activated what did we talk about just a few minutes ago we made a trading plan for what for the Silver Bullet for the 0.75 level this right there would be your entry and you could place your stop loss here but for your silver bullet it usually close to the Drone liquidity so to make the RR worth it you can indeed have a more aggressive stop loss why because the 0.75 level you are not expecting a huge retracement you're expecting a sting into a fair value Gap and then we continue lower again to be a master of that you need to practice that don't just blindly place your stop loss everywhere we will have a specific video about stop-loss placements as well so right here we got to a trading plan for every single swing rate level and you can see that we could have entered under one hour as well and we use the fractal nature of the market to even go into the one minute alright here we are on USD JPY and if we now get to a context again I think you all may know the context by now but we came into that monthly or block right there then the next Target on a monthly basis is of course that I right there so if we Zoom back into the daily time frame then we can see that that already gives us our context because we're moving from this discount array on a monthly basis to that premium array that first premium array on a monthly basis and that creates this intermediate term low to that intermediate term high right there so what do you do you draw your swing rates from that low to that high right there and you go over the exact same things so right here on 0.25 level you can see all right we we didn't do that much maybe on a four hour basis we had a nice entry you can definitely see that once we reach the 0.5 level we have a huge retracement on the four hour basis what is that that's a huge liquidity sweep that is happening right there and then we continue higher to the 0.75 level where we now have what this first verify Gap getting respected and then we continue higher off of that AKA your silver bullet setup so so this could even be your entry on a daily time frame now let's use the same exact example that we used in a previous video about a New York strategy here we are on the four hour time frame now here we have that daily fair value cup to work with we have this new four hour fair value Gap right there that St and if we dive into the five minute and take a look at that price action right there on a five minute basis we can see that we are coming into that four hour five value Gap right there and here again we are using the same exact steps we draw our swing rates from that intermediate term low to that intermediate term High then we have the same level so now the levels are inverse we have 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 and of course one Terminus what happens at the 0.25 level not too much to be honest there's no entry there alright perfect no entry there no worries again trading plan is about picking your poison so we might miss a move there perfectly fine what happens after 0.5 we see the most price action right there at 0.5 again where we have some kind of consolidation because we have a lot of price action right there it's at equilibrium afterwards we see what we see again a nice trading setup we first off have this trading setup but if you want to enter an overlapping PD Ray then yes you might have missed the entry there perfectly fine because an entry after that is right there it's exactly what we went over with the perfect entry it's right there with the same mechanical steps to go over and then afterwards we reach the 0.75 level so now we know all right that could be our Silver Bullet so we want to enter on the first prior value Gap right there which is right there and you can see it didn't reach into that overlapping PD Ray because at that moment in time it doesn't have to anymore with data Target or of course you can even Target a higher you're not restricted to just that Target and that is exactly how you can form a mechanical trading plan using just structure now you could just make a trading plan without the swing rates just using structure but you can also use the swing rates because they give you a guideline they can give you a mechanical guideline because we can make different rules for every single level for 0 to 25 or 0.5 for the 0.75 pick one of them Master one of them first and then after you can incorporate other levels please pick one first Master it study it and stick to it and by the way look at how beautiful the fair value gaps are telling you a story right there again the overlapping high with that verify Gap getting respected and it's displacing higher just a reminder enrollments of the master class are opening up on the 25th of August so that is this Friday limited spots are available there are only three spots left so if you want to be a part of that if you want to be a part of the money making team it's called the money making team for a reason because the students excluding me have racked up 1.4 million plus in assets under management in a very small amount of time and then again if you haven't watched the structure video I would highly advise you to do so and if you have watched it please give it a re-watch and the fair value gaps are telling you a story video is also very important to re-watch because then the whole story the whole A to Z guide makes more sense the more videos there are because they are all connected in some way or another alright perfect thank you foreign</p>

the same exact steps we draw our swing rates from that intermediate term low to that intermediate term High then we have the same level so now the levels are inverse we have 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 and of

## <p>so power of 3 AKA AMD Cycles AKA o h l c and o l h c so what do all these things mean first off power of three what is the power what is the three power of three refers to accumulation manipulation distribution AMD cycle is also accumulation manipulation distribution ohlc is open high low close it refers to a candle on how it opens makes the high makes the low and then closes same for o l h c open low high close that would of course be a bullish candle and open high low close would be a bearish candle so that is what it stands for now how can we use power of three and what do these things actually mean so just to give you some context right here this is both or Forex both for indices this is also for Commodities this is for everything in the market every single Market you can name that is what it works on every single one first I will go into the sessions how we can use them on sessions and slowly and gradually I will zoom out and at the end it will make the most sense so if you follow along with the progress then it will make a lot of sense at first it might be a little bit confusing but that's why I'm here to warn you because allow that confusion to be there and then at the end it will all of a sudden make a lot more sense alright if we dive into the five minutes and we look at a London open so at the London kill zone right here at what time does London Kill Zone start at 2 am right that's what we touched on then we have that candle or London open if we zoom in a little bit more on that candle right there that is the open of the candle right and when we refer to open low high close open right there the low of the candle a high close and if you look at the top left right there you'll see the exact numbers that we're using right there that is the Open high low close and if we have a bearish candle on this candle for example it would be open high low close for this candle we now use the open of that candle because that is the open of our London Kill Zone if we now zoom out again what is actually happening here where is the end of London Killzone this candle this 455 is actually the end because on this candle we already start at 5 am so the open of this candle is your end and the close of that candle is also your end so just for Simplicity sake I will Mark the open of that candle because that is your ending right there of the London Kill Zone so if we look at what happens right here what do we see open hi low close that is the exact same thing that we are seeing on every candle so if we now zoom in and I'm going to zoom in on a specific candle for example this candle right here open hi low close this candle could have very well been this London Kill Zone that is the exact same fractal candle so if I now use the FX Market sessions indicator again and inside the settings I turned on the candle display what can we see we can see an exact candle right here this is what it would look like on a three hour candle because the London Killzone is three hours so in those three hours what happens on the lower time frame is we open we have a high created right there we have the low created and then we close that is the basics of it now of course we also want to go over power of 3 and AMD Cycles accumulation manipulation distribution what is accumulation what is manipulation what is distribution accumulation happens at the opening range let's first go over manipulation manipulation is the top right here if we are expecting a bearish candle for example like this then the top this Wick is the manipulation so everything above the open right there is the manipulation of course if we were expecting bullish prices then the bottom Wick would have been manipulation because that is where price is manipulating it is manipulating who it is manipulating retail traders to go long right here and then it's doing the exact opposite right there then what is our accumulation phase our accumulation if we now drag our Fibonacci from this high from the top of the manipulation so the top of that Wick back to the open and we have a symmetrical swing so you have one zero minus 1. so these are the Fibonacci settings right here very simple and you have a symmetrical swing of that manipulation this is your accumulation phase what does that mean when you want to get involved in the market ideally you want to get involved in the manipulation phase if you can't get involved in a manipulation phase or you want to wait a little bit longer than this accumulation phase this is where you want to get involved so after we come below that accumulation phase that is not where you want to get involved anymore at least not looking for shorts then what is our distribution phase our distribution phase is what we just saw on manipulation the top of the wick to the open but now it's the opposite it is that bottom of the wick to the clothes that Wick right there that is your distribution what is it Distributing it is Distributing profit that it made from this manipulation right there and this accumulation and right there it is taking profit who is taking profit well you can argue an algorithm central banks Etc institutions are taking profit right there and who are they profiting off of opposing liquidity again retail liquidity with retail liquidity I'm of course referring to retail Concepts bigger hedge funds Etc that are trading retail Concepts that are getting trapped right there so right here liquidity got trapped into the market us or not really us but the central banks Etc institutions they are in the market right there so they for example are in the market right there where do they want to Target they want to Target at opposing liquidity what is opposing liquidity well we trapped in Long Traders right there now we want to trap in short Traders so we can take Longs we can do the exact opposite and we can take profit which is aiming for those lows right there and eventually we slowly start to take profit right here and that is why you are seeing these moves up right there and that is exactly the reason why we move higher even from here so accumulation manipulation distribution but we don't just apply the power 3 and we don't just look at accumulation manipulation distribution everywhere there needs to be context behind it in this sense and the reason why I started on the sessions and applying the power 3 there is because right here it will maybe be a bit confusing but once we slowly zoom out now it will make a lot more sense so right here if I remove this Fibonacci this again is our London session now what is our London session come into it comes into liquidity what kind of liquidity if we zoom out on the one hour right here it is taking liquidity above a one hour high right there going back to fill in this fair value Gap completely with that order block right there and what does it do right now on the five minute we can see we are trapping long Traders and then we are dropping off and then where are we heading if we now zoom out on the daily what can we see we are reaching for that previous day low into a daily fair value gap which is a very clean Target to aim for if you now drop back down into the five minute long Traders threat we are in a short position aiming for again liquidity right there and we have a daily provide Gap right there and we have the previous day low right there that is our distribution and can you see here the importance of those skill zones the importance of time right there because right there at the end of London we create the low of the day now if we now go into the next session for example we go into New York right there that is New York and and the open of New York is right there what can you notice I noticed the exact same thing we take some liquidity there we first have to move down the manipulation phase accumulation right there and then afterwards we have distribution right there distribution at what at a fair value Gap right there you need to remember what we talked about where value gaps or the blocks are also liquidity and we have the exact same cycle we have the manipulation the accumulation and the distribution so if I pull up the FX Market sessions again we now see the exact same thing with that candle the manipulation accumulation their distribution at what level at an opposing premium array discount array to a premium array that is our distribution right there our power of three but what if we now zoom out a little bit more here we are on the daily time frame we just mentioned this daily fair value Gap with that previous day low right there what do we see on the daily candles open low high close we see the exact same thing what does it reach into a discount array what is it aiming for on this Thursday we have an open low a high close what is happening there and why is Friday dropping off AKA our thank God it's Friday right there an opposing premium array again on these individual days you have accumulation you have manipulation and you have Distribution on each individual candle so if we dive into these individual candles again the time you would use can be just that candles open off of the daily time frame what I mostly do and what most people do is you will use the midnight open of New York right there at that open Dead little up candle right there that is zero zero zero zero that is New York midnight open that is what institutions refer to because they want to be buying below the midnight open on bullish days the same exact thing we just saw on the London session same exact thing as we saw in New York session so right here when it comes below that right here this is where we want to get involved and then right here what do we see again if we now draw a Fibonacci again from this low to that open this is your accumulation phase this is where you want to get involved to Target those potential highs to Target these highs and to Target even the whole weekly range manipulation accumulation and then at the end of the week what do we see distribution right there this is the top of the week because this is applying it to every single day but if we now zoom out and go to every week what do we see manipulation with the accumulation so accumulation manipulation distribution we see the exact same Canon if we Mark that open again and then go into the daily time frame again we want to be buying below that open if we are expecting a bullish week can you now see how it is starting to make sense and how it is fractal we went from sessions to days to now weeks all the same stuff and to now even months here we are on the monthly time frame if I now go on to the monthly time frame and I use this volume imbalance or even this fair value Gap right there what do we see we see the exact same thing open low high close open a high low close if we now go back into the daily time frame and where does the month start right here and where did this month start right there on that day can you see how in both months this month and this month we are first having that manipulation then we have the meat in the middle aka the trending days if we refer this back to a weekly profile that we just saw on this weekly right there what does this create it's just your weekly profile within it but a weekly profile you would more Define it you would more zoom in so if we refer back to this monthly candle this is the exact same as a as a weekly profile just you can say a monthly profile you would have Monday consolidation your Tuesday high of the month right there then we have Wednesday trending Thursday training and then eventually right here when the month ends we have your thank God it's Friday setup and we have the close of the month right there that is the exact same thing and the exact same thing happens here we have Monday or Tuesday trending trending Thursday Friday right here caps the month so at the beginning and the end of the month you want to be careful with getting involved and then in a new month you want to be careful trying to long this because this could very well be your manipulation phase and then the meet in the middle where the trend is the same for the week I always say if you want to get involved in a trend mainly focus on Tuesday and Wednesday and maybe Thursday but again remember the weekly profiles Thursday is TR and the trend could very well end the same or the month the same for the day same for the sessions all the exact same so right here if we now apply the weekly profiles we can see the exact same right if we go back to the weekly we have that manipulation the accumulation Distribution on each and every candle so if we Mark the opens that is exactly where we would want to get involved above the open of that candle if we then go into the daily we can see again when we are coming into that premium array we want to Mark those opens and we want to get involved above those opens and if we dive into then sessions we want to use the exact same thing and that is a very good guideline using these opens on how we can get involved at the best prices now you can see that I am not just taking any candle open and any candle close Etc there needs to be context behind it and that is why I didn't I didn't start off the A to Z guide with power three here you go just use this no I started off the A to Z guide with PD arrays higher time frame because understanding this monthly context understanding the weekly context right here that we are coming into this fair value Gap that is exactly what we need to understand first because then when we have that open and we sting into a premium array because we know we saw that premium rate coming and then we have our accumulation our expansion and then with an opposing discount array we can now have the distribution that is very important you're not just taking power of three because there's a power three no you need to combine it with PD arrays and that's exactly what we went over so every single power three I mentioned here it was combined with a premium or a discount array it wasn't just any power 3 it was in combination in context these Concepts need to be working in harmony they are all working in Harmony and that's exactly what makes so beautiful so right here we went from the sessions to the days which forms what the daily profiles we went over we weren't from the days to the weeks which forms what the weekly profiles we went over and then we went from the weeks to the months and you could even create your own monthly profile study this if you want send me markups directly to me on Twitter not through DM because my DMs are a bit full if you just sent me the Tweet itself or an Instagram story itself I'll see it and I'll be able to take a look at it alright perfect thank you thank you [Music]</p>

so power of 3 AKA AMD Cycles AKA o h l c and o l h c so what do all these things mean first off power of three what is the power what is the three power of three refers to accumulation manipulation distribution AMD cycle is also accumulation manipulation distribution ohlc is open high low close it refers to a candle on how it opens makes the high makes the low and then closes same for o l h c open low high close that would of course be a bullish candle and open high low close would be a bearish candle so that is what it stands for now how can we use power of three and what do these things actually mean so just to give you some context right here this is both or Forex both for indices this is also for Commodities this is for everything in the market every single Market you can name that is what it works on every single one first I will go into the sessions how we can use them on sessions and slowly and gradually I will zoom out and at the end it will make the most sense so if you follow along with the progress then it will make a lot of sense at first it might be a little bit confusing but that's why I'm here to warn you because allow that confusion to be there and then at the end it will all of a sudden make a lot more sense alright if we dive into the five minutes and we look at a London open so at the London kill zone right here at what time does London Kill Zone start at 2 am right that's what we touched on then we have that candle or London open if we zoom in a little bit more on that candle right there that is the open of the candle right and when we refer to open low high close open right there the low of the candle a high close and if you look at the top left right there you'll see the exact numbers that we're using right there that is the Open high low close and if we have a bearish candle on this candle for example it would be open high low close for this candle we now use the open of that candle because that is the open of our London Kill Zone if we now zoom out again what is actually happening here where is the end of London Killzone this candle this 455 is actually the end because on this candle we already start at 5 am so the open of this candle is your end and the close of that candle is also your end so just for Simplicity sake I will Mark the open of that candle because that is your ending right there of the London Kill Zone so if

have an open low a high close what is happening there and why is Friday dropping off AKA our thank God it's Friday right there an opposing premium array again on these individual days you have accumulation you have manipulation and you have Distribution on each individual candle so if we dive into these individual candles again the time you would use can be just that candles open off of the daily time frame what I mostly do and what most people do is you will use the midnight open of New York right there at that open Dead little up candle right there that is zero zero zero zero that is New York midnight open that is what institutions refer to because they want to be buying below the midnight open on bullish days the same exact thing we just saw on the London session same exact thing as we saw in New York session so right here when it comes below that right here this is where we want to get involved and then right here what do we see again if we now draw a Fibonacci again from this low to that open this is your accumulation phase this is where you want to get involved to Target those potential highs to Target these highs and to Target even the whole weekly range

## <p>all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video now we are slowly starting to get into the more advanced stuff and I'm absolutely loving it I'm very excited for it so in the previous seven episodes so the first seven episodes that you watched on the A to Z guide they were touching on PD erase so that is premium erase and discount arrays so either bullish arrays or bearish arrays and these BD rays are where price can reject off of where price can potentially push a higher from or pushlower from so these PD Rays what that creates is a PD array Matrix now obviously that's just a very fancy word and I'm going to dive into price and show you exactly what that is ETC now in the top right you can probably tell there is flood and there is lot that is first line of defense and last line of defense so if we take a look at this price action lag right here we have a swing high right here and a swing low right there dead in itself so this right here is a price action lag that is a price action lack we arefocusing on right now again swing High swing low is something we will get into don't worry just keep in mind that this is a price action lag inside that price action lag inside that price action lag we are scouting in this case obviously also with the help of hindsight we are looking at bearish prices so we are scouting for all premium arrays so please do me a favor and go over all the premium Rays inside that price action lag there is verify Gap right there overlapping with this order block then we have this River Gap but there is alsoa BPR and then the last one is that high and that high is a liquidity pool so in this case we have a first line of defense what is our first line of defense here Dead Further Gap overlapping with that order block that is our first line of defense now we can even argue of course at the absolute first line of defense right here is this fair value Gap because the order block line is a little bit higher as you can see right there and then the last line of defense is what that high so when we have a retracement and we cansee the retracement is happening right there when we have that retracement one of those PD arrays should hold so right there we have a first line of defense and the last line of defense and that is very important for you to understand so if we move on right here we are having a new price action lag lower we have this swing High we have this swing low inside that what do we create we are creating an order block right there we are creating a fair value Gap right there then we have some sort of rejection block I like the big wickright there and then the last line of defense would be that high right there the first line of defense would be dead that verify again right there what happens right here we are disrespecting this last line of defense so what does that create a new price action lack something new that we can work with what is the recent price action lag right there swing low swing High what is the first line of defense that fair value Gap right there what is the last line of defense that a low That Swing Low right there so ideally we should not come below thatswimming low and again remember the liquidity pulls we can come below this low right here but we shouldn't stay below that low so that is very important so we have a first line of defense and we have a last line of defense obviously inside of that first line of defense and less line of defense we have even more discount arrays as in that high and this or block as well and that makes it interesting because then we can get a clearer view of where price will likely reject off of because obviously we now have a lot ofPD arrays inside One Price action lag and I already told you in the previous videos on where we can expect price to actually reject off of and we see the perfect example in this price action lag and in this price action lag and even in this price I can lag as well right whenever there's multiple overlapping PD rays that is exactly that is the most beautiful place where we want to see price reject off of what do we have here we have that high and we have this verify Gap what makes it two PD arrays two discount racewhat do we reject off of here we have that verify Gap and we have this overlapping order block what does that make premium race what does this right hair make we have this first line of defense but right here we have a verify Gap and we have that order block right there what does that make two discount arrays and then right there this would be your last line of defense That Swing Low and this is your price action lag obviously swing low to swing high so whenever the first line of defense is holding you can probably notice acertain pattern it is usually nine out of 10 times it is overlapping so whenever you see that first line of defense holding and usually first line of defense is 9 out of 10 times it is a fair value Gap and the thing I want you to focus on when we have that first line of defense and it is usually a fair value Gap is that fair value Gap overlapping with another premium or discount array if yes there's a high chance that the first line of defense will hold if it doesn't hold we have certain PD arrays in the middle and then we have that lastline of defense that last line of defense should not get violated should not get invalidated alright so if we take a look at a bit more price action right here we are having right there we have an order block and a fair value Gap right perfectly right there right there this high is the first line of defense right that old high so this high would be your first line of defense so in this case it isn't the fair value Gap but if we take a look just a bit lower what do we see we see two discount arrays overlapping with each otherand that is what I'm trying to tell you that is what makes it so strong now what is your last line of defense right here dead right there that is your last line of defense this load shouldn't get invalidated now the thing I want you to understand is we need to think in probabilities so yes sometimes it might bounce off of a fair value Gap without an overlapping PD array yes sometimes it might not even get into different value Gap and it might just take off yes sometimes the last line of defense will get violatedand price will still continue in that intended direction that we first had and that is completely normal because this stuff this trading stuff is not binary and that's where a lot of people go wrong they think it is binary they think when I tell someone it is low probability conditions that you should 100 lose because low probability conditions oh you should lose it's binary and that's absolutely not the case trading is probabilities and when I tell you it is either high probability or low probability it isabout probabilities it is not binary yes you can still win in low probability conditions yes you can still lose in high probability conditions but the odds in high probability conditions are way more in your favor so let's say we have an 80 win rate in high probability conditions and we have a 20 win rate in low probability conditions yes there is still a chance that we can win in low probability conditions but always ask yourself if you had a million in capital or even 10 million in capital would you risk it ona day where you know the odds are not in your favor and that's the same for those fair value gaps when these fair value gaps are not overlapping with another PD array just know yes they could still play out but the probabilities are way higher when you wait for it to come into effect that is overlapping with another PD array and that is so crucial for you to understand that these these things are not binary and that's what a lot of people think and it might seem very obvious what I'm saying right here but but I've seen somany people that are trading low probability conditions and they tell others oh but I'm winning in low probability conditions yeah yes you are getting very lucky the probabilities are still there's 20 you can win absolutely so you just dodged a bullet but if you do it on the long run that is likely not going to end very well and that's the exact same with overlapping PD arrays etc etc all right I want you please to study this study the price action lag study the PD Ray Matrix the first line of defenselast line of defense and also study what happens if that last line of defense does get violated and again remember right last line of defense yes we can take a liquidity pool before we move lower or before we move higher but there's a certain type of invalidation and again that's where you're studying comes in as well and I've mentioned it as well so study that when does the first line of defense hold if it doesn't hold why doesn't it hold see the probabilities play out then on Sunday we have a live stream 8 30 a.mNew York local time so feel free to tune in and we can just have a little chat and if I don't see you at the live stream I will see you on next Tuesday on the next episode on the A2Z guide alright study take care and thank you foreign </p>

you can see right there and then the last line of defense is what that high so when we have a retracement and we cansee the retracement is happening right there when we have that retracement one of those PD arrays should hold so right there we have a first line of defense and the last line of defense and that is very important for you to understand so if we move on right here we are having a new price action lag lower we have this swing High we have this swing low inside that what do we create we are creating an order block right there we are creating a fair value Gap right there then we have some sort of rejection block I like the big wickright there and then the last line of defense would be that high right there the first line of defense would be dead that verify again right there what happens right here we are disrespecting this last line of defense so what does that create a new price action lack something new that we can work with what is the recent price action lag right there swing low swing High what is the first line of defense that fair value Gap right there what is the last line of defense that a low That Swing Low right there so ideally we should not come below thatswimming low and again remember the liquidity pulls we can come below this low right here but we shouldn't stay below that low so that is very important so we have a first line of defense and we have a last line of defense obviously inside of that first line of defense and less line of defense we have even more discount arrays as in that high and this or block as well and that makes it interesting because then we can get a clearer view of where price will likely reject off of because obviously we now have a lot ofPD arrays inside One Price action lag and I already told you in the previous videos on where we can expect price to actually reject off of and we see the perfect example in this price action lag and in this price action lag and even in this price I can lag as well right whenever there's multiple overlapping PD rays that is exactly that is the most beautiful place where we want to see price reject off of what do we have here we have that high and we have this verify Gap what makes it two PD arrays two discount racewhat do we reject off of here we have that verify Gap and we have this overlapping order block what does that make premium race what does this right hair make we have this first line of defense but right here we have a verify Gap and we have that order block right there what does that make two discount arrays and then right there this would be your last line of defense That Swing Low and this is your price action lag obviously swing low to swing high so whenever the first line of defense is holding you can probably notice acertain pattern it is usually nine out of 10 times it is overlapping so whenever you see that first line of defense holding and usually first line of defense is 9 out of 10 times it is a fair value Gap and the thing I want you to focus on when we have that first line of defense and it is usually a fair value Gap is that fair value Gap overlapping with another premium or discount array if yes there's a high chance that the first line of defense will hold if it doesn't hold we have certain PD arrays in the middle and then we have that lastline of defense that last line of defense should not get violated should not get invalidated alright so if we take a look at a bit more price action right here we are having right there we have an order block and a fair value Gap right perfectly right there right there this high is the first line of defense right that old high so this high would be your first line of defense so in this case it isn't the fair value Gap but if we take a look just a bit lower what do we see we see two discount arrays overlapping with each otherand that is what I'm trying to tell you that is what makes it so strong now what is your last line of defense right here dead right there that is your last line of defense this load shouldn't get invalidated now the thing I want you to understand is we need to think in probabilities so yes sometimes it might bounce off of a fair value Gap without an overlapping PD array yes sometimes it might not even get into different value Gap and it might just take off yes sometimes the last line of defense will get violatedand price will still continue in that intended direction that we first had and that is completely normal because this stuff this trading stuff is not binary and that's where a lot of people go wrong they think it is binary they think when I tell someone it is low probability conditions that you should 100 lose because low probability conditions oh you should lose it's binary and that's absolutely not the case trading is probabilities and when I tell you it is either high probability or low probability it isabout probabilities it is not binary yes you can still win in low probability conditions yes you can still lose in high probability conditions but the odds in high probability conditions are way more in your favor so let's say we have an 80 win rate in high probability conditions and we have a 20 win rate in low probability conditions yes there is still a chance that we can win in low probability conditions but always ask yourself if you had a million in capital or even 10 million in capital would you risk it ona day where you know the odds are not in your favor and that's the same for those fair value gaps when these fair value gaps are not overlapping with another PD array just know yes they could still play out but the probabilities are way higher when you wait for it to come into effect that is overlapping with another PD array and that is so crucial for you to understand that these these things are not binary and that's what a lot of people think and it might seem very obvious what I'm saying right here but but I've seen somany people that are trading low probability conditions and they tell others oh but I'm winning in low probability conditions yeah yes you are getting very lucky the probabilities are still there's 20 you can win absolutely so you just dodged a bullet but if you do it on the long run that is likely not going to end very well and that's the exact same with overlapping PD arrays etc etc all right I want you please to study this study the price action lag study the PD Ray Matrix the first line of defenselast line of defense and also study what happens if that last line of defense does get violated and again remember right last line of defense yes we can take a liquidity pool before we move lower or before we move higher but there's a certain type of invalidation and again that's where you're studying comes in as well and I've mentioned it as well so study that when does the first line of defense hold if it doesn't hold why doesn't it hold see the probabilities play out then on Sunday we have a live stream 8 30 a.mNew York local time so feel free to tune in and we can just have a little chat and if I don't see you at the live stream I will see you on next Tuesday on the next episode on the A2Z guide alright study take care and thank you foreign

## <p>swing trading is a lost art I've been having some great suggestions by a lot of people through my email through my Discord that I've been saying what happened what has happened in the past couple years because people used to talk always about swing trading and then all of a sudden the scalping the faster action got introduced and all of a sudden all the people jumped on the bandwagon to scalp to day trade instead of Swing trading again there's nothing wrong with that but the reality of things is that a lot of people are just busy throughout the day they don't have time to sculpt they don't have time to day trade which is completely normal so in that case you're almost a little bit lost you're like what should I do everyone is sculpting everyone's day trading how can I get to a swing trade it's not talked about enough nowadays now since everything I do and since everything I teach is very fractal I'm going to go over exactly how you can get to a swing trading plan even a position trading plan sure short-term trading plan where you hold trade over potentially even a couple of hours that would be the shortest term but think about a couple of days think about catching the weekly range think about even catching the monthly range you can make it as crazy as you want to and I'm going to show you how so inside the mentorship as well this is something I go very in depth on because you need a unique trading plan that fits your time schedule and fits your personality so if this fits your time schedule and it fits your personality then this is perfect for you now first off I have a notion prepared for you the notion is in the link in description if you could please pause the video here and open that notion I will also show it on my screen in a bit I will show what I'm talking about but if you have the notion on just another screen next to you then that would be very helpful alright we start off with we are always trading either in a monthly weekly or daily context if you're not sure what I mean or what I'm aiming at with context then I would highly advise to after this video watch the previous video which was on Market maker models now again you don't need to exactly know what Market maker models are as long as you understand the context let's say that we have a monthly context now I'm sorry to bother you again with UC JPY but this is such a beautiful example and this is exactly the high probability price action that you would want so let's take a look at this price action right here if we take a look at this monthly verify Gap right there and this monthly order block right there if we are continuing higher we are likely continuing higher off of that monthly or the block and a monthly fever right so we already have our monthly context because the monthly context is that we are going higher off of this discount rate and we are targeting this premium array right there in between this low to that high right there that is where we want to get involved but how are are we getting involved if we go into the four hour on this particular price action right there here we are zoomed in on price action on 4 hour now I'm using the replay too I want to show you and take you to the thought process because you can see there is no confusion if you have the context correct again the context will take practice but the entry model itself there is no confusion at all so what do we do once we reach our discount array right there the monthly discount rate the first thing we wait for is a bullish verify Gap right there only a bullish for Vega right there that is our SD again there's a separate video on that as well that SC again you don't need a Microsoft to shift just a bullish for Photograph right there on the four hour time frame before going into the four hour time frame or any time frame that I want to execute on I already know the steps that I want to take because it's context that context can be defined even more because inside that context we have our PD array that we want to trade off of and we have our longer term Target then the entry time frame that is where we want to have an st that first fair value Gap then we want to have a second fair value Gap coming off of a discount array which is just your short term range which we talked about in a market structure video so St new short-term range off of that SC overlapping pdra that is where we want to enter that is called your original entry so let's skip price a little bit right there we have a new fair value Gap higher than we want to enter on the first overlapping part the first overlapping part is that for Value Gap with that order block right there where do we place our stop loss our stop loss is always on the original entry type it's always beneath this intermediate term low or of course an intermediate term high so again it's a step-by-step process context which leads to your PD array that you want to trade off of that context also leads your target inside the PD rate that you had a stab because of the context you want to look for your St new short-term range overlapping PD array that's where you want to enter you cover the intermediate term low or the intermediate term high and you Target around 1 to 2 RR what do I mean with around one to two RR sounds very vague right it's not so if we draw R2 out and we go to one to two RR what is close to the one to two RR right there we have some kind of order block and we have that fair value Gap so either what you can do and again this is personal preference you gather data on this and you see what suits you the best then right there what I would advise you to start off with is just a one to two nothing more just make it easy for yourself just a one to two you don't need to talk to the left only thing you need to do is one to two once you can get more advanced and you gather the data around it then you can potentially look at targeting even more but we start off with a one to two now right here we get tagged in right there we experience some drawdown perfect and then eventually it hits our Target in the meantime there's more things that I want to go over because ideally when you are swing trading so every single entry that I will show you ideally you want to be entering on a Monday Tuesday or a Wednesday again a Monday if we have the news going for us like we talked about in news episodes or a Tuesday where we have news or Wednesday where we have news that's your ideal scenario then of course once we are in the trade what are we looking to do we are looking to manage our risk inside the notion you will see that I have a rule go break even when price has no reason to return based on a lot and flood lot again remember it's less live defense plot is first line of defense So based on flood and lot when can we go break even right here we've been tagged in right there we have this new fair value Gap higher right there this entry where we just entered right there and we have this lag hire this new short term range from this low to that high is there a reason for price to come back to our entry and then go higher yes because based on the first line of defense we have this breaker right there sitting at our entry and we have this fair value Gap right there and the last line of defense is way beneath our original entry so yes there is a reason the price can return to our entry right there then if we follow along with price action eventually we will see we have a new fair value up there we have an order lock there now there's no new swing low being created so there's no new short-term range this is still your short-term range is there a reason for price to come back to your entry right there yes there is so what do we do we follow again the new short-term range this new short-term range from this low to that high what is your first line of defense that's for very Gap afterwards you have this order block right there you have this mitigation block as well right there and this is your last long defense that last line of defense is it above your entry is there a reason for price to come back to your entry right there no there is not so at this moment in time once this fair value Gap right there so let me show you this fair value cup has been created right there that is when you go break even why this revive Gap and not that for Value Gap because this for Value Gap is above that high to the left right there that is when you go break even because based on that on the short-term ranges and on the flood and the lot there's no reason for price to do this you don't keep your stop-loss at these lows at the intermediate term low just because you're like oh I don't know it might do something like this and then go to your heart I just want to take the win I'll do whatever it takes I just want to win no go break even please protect your Capital it's very important so this right here is the first entry which we call for a monthly context this is your original entry after the original entry has played out you either miss the trade and it played out or it played out and you were a part of it no either one of those what you want to do is you now want to zoom out and you want to go up in time frames when you go up in time frames we again have a step-by-step process because we're still trading the same exact thing from the monthly context that discount rate to the premium array right there the thing you want to do is what you see in notion it is called the re-entry opportunity it is important to understand that first the four hour opportunity already happened 4 Hour entry is either missed or you are already Break Even or it already hit take profit so you need to be at least break even that's the minimum then you want to zoom out to the Daily time frame enter on the overlapping part of the short term range cover short term low slash short term high now right here it is pretty vague because right here we don't really have an overlapping part we have somewhat of a short-term range but it's still part of our intermediate term low perfect let's not take this trade let's wait let's wait until we have a new short-term range this right here is what it's our new short-term range so we have a signal an alarm goes off and right now we want to pay attention because now we follow the steps again we enter on the overlapping part of the short term range the overlapping part is right there because we have this first line of defense then the overlapping part right there overlapping is always a fair value Gap with another discount rate so it's either a fair value Gap with an order Block Breaker block or mitigation block and we have this last line of defense right there so we already know we want to enter on the overlapping part right there that is our entry and we cover what we cover the short term low or the short term high of that short term range which is initially that low right there now once we target this High what can we see it's a 0.8 0.8 RR in this case you are also allowed to cover only the bodies of the candles right there then your target is the context high or low so in this case we are trading a monthly context so we are using the monthly context high or low and of course the target is the monthly context a high right there then again same thing we go break even when price has no reason to return based on lot and flood so right here we get tagged in right there and we torque those highs now again what you can do it's important you can Target on the re-engy a 2R as well but you don't need to Target because if you already wear a part of the first move then it's perfectly fine to just Target that monthly high but this is also where your data Gathering Etc comes in the only thing that I want you to understand you can for sure Target just a one to two right there you can do that but I want you to be Break Even once we reach that original Target in form the monthly context High you need to be break even right there whatever happens after it's fine as long as you break even So eventually we reach that original Target and then eventually we are still in the motion to continue to that one to two RR right there this is a trading plan on the monthly context but we also have a weekly context trading plan and we also have a daily context trading plan and each of the contexts can be defined by you have your original opportunity your original entry and the re entry and they're all the same they're just fractal so let's go over the weekly context and the daily context as well alright weekly context so if we zoom out to the weekly we have this verify Gap right there we have that order Block it's just important to understand the weekly context right here is that we are moving higher from that discount array on a weekly basis and we're targeting that original high right there that discount rate to that premium array that is exactly your weekly context now again it's important to understand I am doing it in this order the monthly context to the weekly context to the Daily context that is the highest probability but if you only have a weekly context then that's perfectly fine if you only have a daily context then it's also perfectly fine as long as it's high probability a high probability meaning that you're Scouting For the pairs for the instruments I have a list of the pairs inside the Notions a list of the instruments that you will be going over and you will be going over them and scouting those pairs and scouting the price action on those instruments and seeing on The Daily weekly or monthly what is the highest probability instruments that I can trade for the coming week so that is something that is a process you would do on the weekend and then when you're truly busy throughout the week the only thing you need to do is you need to focus on we're coming into that context area so the pity array and we want to look for our entry model that's all it is the hard work is done when you do have the time on the weekend to look at the highest probability instruments that you want to be trading now again it's important to understand you don't execute on multiple pairs all at once be careful with your risk maximum two percent risk at the time so that means if you're risking one percent on every setup then there's only two setups that you can take at that time if you're already in a trade with one percent risk then you can only take a maximum of one new trade so that is how you find the pair and that is where the hard work is done the hard work is when you do have the time again I call it hard work but it's truly not hard work it takes me literal seconds to see if a pair is high probability now again you might not have that experience just yet and you might take some more losses in the beginning which is completely fine you need to understand that that is part of the process so accept that you need to accept that fact all right if we go over the weekly context our original entry is again one hour St Plus for Value Gap plus overlapping entry then we have a cover intermediate term low slash intermediate term High Target 2R minimum go break even when price is no reason to return based on lot and flood so if we use the replay tool right here we go into the one hour and we wait for price to come into that Weekly verify Gap here we are on the one hour time frame and prices just came into the weekly fair value Gap right there where we expect prices to move higher because we have that context discount array to pre-mumorate first thing we see is an st right there the next thing we need is a new short-term range so that is where we have a new short-term range now we're waiting and we want to enter on the overlapping part we have this overlapping part right there that high with the for Five Guys overlapping so we enter off of that that is our first entry but what you'll see we create a new short-term range higher when that happens you follow along with the short-term range until you do get an entry opportunity right there and the RR is still worth it so let me explain what that means right here you would enter on the overflapping part again you cover the intermediate term low again you can cover the bodies right there that's perfectly fine and then you target a one to two which is sitting right there start off with one to two it's perfectly fine afterwards what you're seeing is you have new ranges higher and your way to go break even now let's say you missed this then you go over the checklist was there an opportunity yes they're already he was an opportunity so you don't enter again you don't follow the short-term ranges again you would not take a new entry right there for example that breaker with the value Gap it's not a one hour entry you would take and then once the original entry has happened and we could see that it is a hit or take profit right there then what do we do we now go into the four hour time frame because re-entry for the weekly context one hour opportunity has already happened one hour entry is either missed or your break even or of course you hit take profit Etc that doesn't really matter zoom out to the 4 Hour time frame enter on the overflowing part again same process that we did on the monthly context four hour right here and let's not forget when would you go break even on this trade right here this is where it's more difficult to decide to go break even but again I'll explain to you when I would go break even after this candle higher we are closer to the Target right there then we are to the entry right there now again based on lot and flood right there there's our lot and this is our plot that for Value being created or even in the meantime that breaker right there then we do have a reason to come back but based on your logic all the videos that we have gone over is it logical for price again when it's close to the Drone liquidity right there when it's close to your target as well for price to come all the way back down there and then go higher no so you go break even right there when you see it's close to your Target and the lot is just just below your entry right there this is still where you would go break even and afterwards what do we do we look for our re-entry so the same context and we look for our re-entry we're entering on the short term range so we skip price we have a first short-term range right here but again let's wait for a new short-term range if we do get that we don't get a new short-term range and we take out that Target before getting a new short-term range perfect we missed a potential entry opportunity right there perfectly fine you will miss more entry opportunities this will not be the last time but you will miss an entry opportunity the important part is once that Target has been taken what did we talk about again you need new contacts always there needs to be context that is the main premise behind everything then for our last one our daily context if we go and look at the old price action what we just saw actually if we go look at the same context that we had we were inside a monthly context and we had this daily short-term range right there and then right there we go into the one hour time frame here we are in that daily context because we're moving from a daily discount to that daily premium array right there so that is our Target now we wait again for our one hour St plus verify Gap plus overlapping entry right there we have our first St but we didn't get a new short-term range higher so we wait then right here we have our first St again because you would count this as a new St once we take out that first St right there and you wait you wait for a new short-term range higher that is where we have a new short-term range higher so you want to enter on an overlapping part anything with a fair value Gap that is overlapping with either a high or whatever it is then right there since this high is what it's already overlapping with because inside of that High inside this is what there's a fair value Gap sitting right there which we'll do now is you cover again the bodies of the intermediate term low right there and then if there's an opportunity for one to two RR then we take the trade and we see there's not an opportunity right there for one to two so 1.71 now since we are still in the monthly context I would allow it to charge that 1 to 2 which is just above that high right there only because we are still in a bigger context and then again it's important to ask yourself did you already take the daily trade based on a monthly context or are you just taking this one hour trade based off of the daily context inside that bigger monthly context whenever you have context in context in context so you have your daily and context of the weekly and the weeklies and context to monthly that is the highest probability price action so right here this is something I would allow that is valid in my opinion after that when do we go break even perfect this is already a perfect opportunity to go break even close to the Drone liquidity would we expect to come back to that tiny order block right there to then continue higher no of course not doesn't make any sense so right there we are break even so what can we do we can actually look at already a new entry opportunity on the four hour and in the four hour what are we seeing we have this right there let me remove the one hour right there let's remind ourselves or what of what our Target is which is right there that is our one hour Target let's remove the entry and let's look at a four hour entry because now we're doing the exact same thing for our entry we enter on the overlapping part which is that high with that overlapping fair value Gap right there and we cover the short-term range which is that low right there and our Target is that high now again since we're in a monthly context could we go for a one to two here as well yes we can we can even use the same exact targets that we had right there but what if this target hits and then all of a sudden it goes back to break even of course that could happen so just use the original easy target right there and make sure you profit off of one of those trades and then eventually this one hits take profit right there and then after another while this one hits take profit as well this is exactly a swing trading plan this is called the swing trading plan Lost Art again the notion is in the link in the description and please do consider subscribing giving a like if you don't want to miss anything turn on your notifications as well do whatever you feel like doing you do want more of this again check out the mentorship as well Link in description you'll love the mentorship and then I'll see you at the next one perfect thank you [Music]</p>

swing trading is a lost art I've been having some great suggestions by a lot of people through my email through my Discord that I've been saying what happened what has happened in the past couple years because people used to talk always about swing trading and then all of a sudden the scalping the faster action got introduced and all of a sudden all the people jumped on the bandwagon to scalp to day trade instead of Swing trading again there's nothing wrong with that but the reality of things is that a lot of people are just busy throughout the day they don't have time to sculpt they don't

trade it's not talked about enough nowadays now since everything I do and since everything I teach is very fractal I'm going to go over exactly how you can get to a swing trading plan even a position trading plan sure short-term trading plan where you hold trade over potentially even a couple of hours that would be the shortest term but think about a couple of days think about catching the weekly range think about even catching the monthly range you can make it as crazy as you want to and I'm going to show you how so inside the mentorship as well this is something I go very in depth on because you need a unique trading plan that fits your time schedule and fits your personality so if this fits your time schedule and it fits your personality then this is perfect for you now first off I have a notion prepared for you the notion is in the link in description if you could please pause the video here and open that notion I will also show it on my screen in a bit I will show what I'm talking about but if you have the notion on just another screen next to you then that would be very helpful alright we start off with we are always trading either in a monthly weekly or daily context if you're not sure what I mean or what I'm aiming at with context then I would highly advise to after this video watch the previous video which was on Market maker models now again you don't need to exactly know what Market maker models are as long as you understand the context let's say that we have a monthly context now I'm sorry to bother you again with UC JPY but this is such a beautiful example and this is exactly the high probability price action that you would want so let's take a look at this price action right here if we take a look at this monthly verify Gap right there and this monthly order block right there if we are continuing higher we are likely continuing higher off of that monthly or the block and a monthly fever right so we already have our monthly context because the monthly context is that we are going higher off of this discount rate and we are targeting this premium array right there in between this low to that high right there that is where we want to get involved but how are are we getting involved if we go into the four hour on this particular price action right there here we are zoomed in on price action on 4 hour now I'm using the replay too I want to show you and take you to the thought process because you can see there is no confusion if you have the context correct again the context will take practice but the entry model itself there is no confusion at all so what do we do once we reach our discount array right there the monthly discount rate the first thing we wait for is a bullish verify Gap right there only a bullish for Vega right there that is our SD again there's a separate video on that as well that SC again you don't need a Microsoft to shift just a bullish for Photograph right there on the four hour time frame before going into the four hour time frame or any time frame that I want to execute on I already know the steps that I want to take because it's context that context can be defined even more because inside that

have a second fair value Gap coming off of a discount array which is just your short term range which we talked about in a market structure video so St new short-term range off of that SC overlapping pdra that is where we want to enter that is called your original entry so let's skip price a little bit right there we have a new fair value Gap higher than we want to enter on the first overlapping part the first overlapping part is that for Value Gap with that order block right there where do we place our stop loss our stop loss is always on the original entry type it's always beneath this intermediate term low or of course an intermediate term high so again it's a step-by-step process context which leads to your PD array that you want to trade off of that context also leads your target inside the PD rate that you had a stab because of the context you want to look for your St new short-term range overlapping PD array that's where you want to enter you cover the intermediate term low or the intermediate term high and you Target around 1 to 2 RR what do I mean with around one to two RR sounds very vague right it's not so if we draw R2 out and we go to one to two RR what is close to the one to two RR right there we have some kind of order block and we have that fair value Gap so either what you can do and again this is personal preference you gather data on this and you see what suits you the best then right there what I would advise you to start off with is just a one to two nothing more just make it easy for yourself just a one to two you don't need to talk to the left only thing you need to do is one to two once you can get more advanced and you gather the data around it then you can potentially look at targeting even more but we start off with a one to two now right here we get tagged in right there we experience some drawdown perfect and then eventually it hits our Target in the meantime there's more things that I want to go over because ideally when you are swing trading so every single entry that I will show you ideally you want to be entering on a Monday Tuesday or a Wednesday again a Monday if we have the news going for us like we talked about in news episodes or a Tuesday where we have news or Wednesday where we have news that's your ideal scenario then of course once we are in the trade what are we looking to do we are looking to manage our risk inside the notion you will see that I have a rule go break even when price has no reason to return based on a lot and flood lot again remember it's less live defense plot is first line of defense So based on flood and lot when can we go break even right here we've been tagged in right there we have this new fair value Gap higher right there this entry where we just entered right there and we have this lag hire this new short term range from this low to that high is there a reason for price to come back to our entry and then go higher yes because based on the first line of defense we have this breaker right there sitting at our entry and we have this fair value Gap right there and the last line of defense is way beneath our original entry so yes there is a reason the price can return to our entry right there then if we follow along with price action eventually we will see we have a new fair value up there we have an order lock there now there's no new swing low being created so there's no new short-term range this is still your short-term range is there a reason for price to come back to your entry right there yes there is so what do we do we follow again the new short-term range this new short-term range from this low to that high what is your first line of defense that's for very Gap afterwards you have this order block right there you have this mitigation block as well right there and this is your last long defense that last line of defense is it above your entry is there a reason for price to come back to your entry right there no there is not so at this moment in time once this fair value Gap right there so let me show you this fair value cup has been created right there that is when you go break even why this revive Gap and not that for Value Gap because this for Value Gap is above that high to the left right there that is when you go break even because based on that on the short-term ranges and on the flood and the lot there's no reason for price to do this you don't keep your stop-loss at these lows at the intermediate term low just because you're like oh I don't know it might do something like this and then go to your heart I just want to take the win I'll do whatever it takes I just want to win no go break even please protect your Capital it's very important so this right here is the first entry which we call for a monthly context this is your original entry after the original entry has played out you either miss the trade and it played out or it played out and you were a part of it no either one of those what you want to do is you now want to zoom out and you want to go up in time frames when you go up in time frames we again have a step-by-step process because we're still trading the same exact thing from the monthly context that discount rate to the premium array right there the thing you want to do is what you see in notion it is called the re-entry opportunity it is important to understand that first the four hour opportunity already happened 4 Hour entry is either missed or you are already Break Even or it already hit take profit so you need to be at least break even that's the minimum then you want to zoom out to the Daily time frame enter on the overlapping part of the short term range cover short term low slash short term high now right here it is pretty vague because right here we don't really have an overlapping part we have somewhat of a short-term range but it's still part of our intermediate term low perfect let's not take this trade let's wait let's wait until we have a new short-term range this right here is what it's our new short-term range so we have a signal an alarm goes off and right now we want to pay attention because now we follow the steps again we enter on the overlapping part of the short term range the overlapping part is right there because we have this first line of defense then the overlapping part right there overlapping is always a fair value Gap with another discount rate so it's either a fair value Gap with an order Block Breaker block or mitigation block and we have this last line of defense right there so we already know we want to enter on the overlapping part right there that is our entry and we cover what we cover the short term low or the short term high of that short term range which is initially that low right there now once we target this High what can we see it's a 0.8 0.8 RR in this case you are also allowed to cover only the bodies of the candles right there then your target is the context high or low so in this case we are trading a monthly context so we are using the monthly context high or low and of course the target is the monthly context a high right there then again same thing we go break even when price has no reason to return based on lot and flood so right here we get tagged in right there and we torque those highs now again what you can do it's important you can Target on the re-engy a 2R as well but you don't need to Target because if you already wear a part of the first move then it's perfectly fine to just Target that monthly high but this is also where your data Gathering Etc comes in the only thing that I want you to understand you can for sure Target just a one to two right there you can do that but I want you to be Break Even once we reach that original Target in form the monthly context High you need to be break even right there whatever happens after it's fine as long as you break even So eventually we reach that original Target and then eventually we are still in the motion to continue to that one to two RR right there this is a trading plan on the monthly context but we also have a weekly context trading plan and we also have a daily context trading plan and each of the contexts can be defined by you have your original opportunity your original entry and the re entry and they're all the same they're just fractal so let's go over the weekly context and the daily context as well alright weekly context so if we zoom out to the weekly we have this verify Gap right there we have that order Block it's just important to understand the weekly context right here is that we are moving higher from that discount array on a weekly basis and we're targeting that original high right there that discount rate to that premium array that is exactly your weekly context now again it's important to understand I am doing it in this order the monthly context to the weekly context to the Daily context that is the highest probability but if you only have a weekly context then that's perfectly fine if you only have a daily context then it's also perfectly fine as long as it's high probability a high probability meaning that you're Scouting For the pairs for the instruments I have a list of the pairs inside the Notions a list of the instruments that you will be going over and you will be going over them and scouting those pairs and scouting the price action on those instruments and seeing on The Daily weekly or monthly what is the highest probability instruments that I can trade for the coming week so that is something that is a process you would do on the weekend and then when you're truly busy throughout the week the only thing you need to do is you need to focus on we're coming into that context area so the pity array and we want to look for our entry model that's all it is the hard work is done when you do have the time on the weekend to look at the highest probability instruments that you want to be trading now again it's important to understand you don't execute on multiple pairs all at once be careful with your risk maximum two percent risk at the time so that means if you're risking one percent on every setup then there's only two setups that you can take at that time if you're already in a trade with one percent risk then you can only take a maximum of one new trade so that is how you find the pair and that is where the hard work is done the hard work is when you do have the time again I call it hard work but it's truly not hard work it takes me literal seconds to see if a pair is high probability now again you might not have that experience just yet and you might take some more losses in the beginning which is completely fine you need to understand that that is part of the process so accept that you need to accept that fact all right if we go over the weekly context our original entry is again one hour St Plus for Value Gap plus overlapping entry then we have a cover intermediate term low slash intermediate term High Target 2R minimum go break even when price is no reason to return based on lot and flood so if we use the replay tool right here we go into the one hour and we wait for price to come into that Weekly verify Gap here we are on the one hour time frame and prices just came into the weekly fair value Gap right there where we expect prices to move higher because we have that context discount array to pre-mumorate first thing we see is an st right there the next thing we need is a new short-term range so that is where we have a new short-term range now we're waiting and we want to enter on the overlapping part we have this overlapping part right there that high with the for Five Guys overlapping so we enter off of that that is our first entry but what you'll see we create a new short-term range higher when that happens you follow along with the short-term range until you do get an entry opportunity right there and the RR is still worth it so let me explain what that means right here you would enter on the overflapping part again you cover the intermediate term low again you can cover the bodies right there that's perfectly fine and then you target a one to two which is sitting right there start off with one to two it's perfectly fine afterwards what you're seeing is you have new ranges higher and your way to go break even now let's say you missed this then you go over the checklist was there an opportunity yes they're already he was an opportunity so you don't enter again you don't follow the short-term ranges again you would not take a new entry right there for example that breaker with the value Gap it's not a one hour entry you would take and then once the original entry has happened and we could see that it is a hit or take profit right there then what do we do we now go into the four hour time frame because re-entry for the weekly context one hour opportunity has already happened one hour entry is either missed or your break even or of course you hit take profit Etc that doesn't really matter zoom out to the 4 Hour time frame enter on the overflowing part again same process that we did on the monthly context four hour right here and let's not forget when would you go break even on this trade right here this is where it's more difficult to decide to go break even but again I'll explain to you when I would go break even after this candle higher we are closer to the Target right there then we are to the entry right there now again based on lot and flood right there there's our lot and this is our plot that for Value being created or even in the meantime that breaker right there then we do have a reason to come back but based on your logic all the videos that we have gone over is it logical for price again when it's close to the Drone liquidity right there when it's close to your target as well for price to come all the way back down there and then go higher no so you go break even right there when you see it's close to your Target and the lot is just just below your entry right there this is still where you would go break even and afterwards what do we do we look for our re-entry so the same context and we look for our re-entry we're entering on the short term range so we skip price we have a first short-term range right here but again let's wait for a new short-term range if we do get that we don't get a new short-term range and we take out that Target before getting a new short-term range perfect we missed a potential entry opportunity right there perfectly fine you will miss more entry opportunities this will not be the last time but you will miss an entry opportunity the important part is once that Target has been taken what did we talk about again you need new contacts always there needs to be context that is the main premise behind everything then for our last one our daily context if we go and look at the old price action what we just saw actually if we go look at the same context that we had we were inside a monthly context and we had this daily short-term range right there and then right there we go into the one hour time frame here we are in that daily context because we're moving from a daily discount to that daily premium array right there so that is our Target now we wait again for our one hour St plus verify Gap plus overlapping entry right there we have our first St but we didn't get a new short-term range higher so we wait then right here we have our first St again because you would count this as a new St once we take out that first St right there and you wait you wait for a new short-term range higher that is where we have a new short-term range higher so you want to enter on an overlapping part anything with a fair value Gap that is overlapping with either a high or whatever it is then right there since this high is what it's already overlapping with because inside of that High inside this is what there's a fair value Gap sitting right there which we'll do now is you cover again the bodies of the intermediate term low right there and then if there's an opportunity for one to two RR then we take the trade and we see there's not an opportunity right there for one to two so 1.71 now since we are still in the monthly context I would allow it to charge that 1 to 2 which is just above that high right there only because we are still in a bigger context and then again it's important to ask yourself did you already take the daily trade based on a monthly context or are you just taking this one hour trade based off of the daily context inside that bigger monthly context whenever you have context in context in context so you have your daily and context of the weekly and the weeklies and context to monthly that is the highest probability price action so right here this is something I would allow that is valid in my opinion after that when do we go break even perfect this is already a perfect opportunity to go break even close to the Drone liquidity would we expect to come back to that tiny order block right there to then continue higher no of course not doesn't make any sense so right there we are break even so what can we do we can actually look at already a new entry opportunity on the four hour and in the four hour what are we seeing we have this right there let me remove the one hour right there let's remind ourselves or what of what our Target is which is right there that is our one hour Target let's remove the entry and let's look at a four hour entry because now we're doing the exact same thing for our entry we enter on the overlapping part which is that high with that overlapping fair value Gap right there and we cover the short-term range which is that low right there and our Target is that high now again since we're in a monthly context could we go for a one to two here as well yes we can we can even use the same exact targets that we had right there but what if this target hits and then all of a sudden it goes back to break even of course that could happen so just use the original easy target right there and make sure you profit off of one of those trades and then eventually this one hits take profit right there and then after another while this one hits take profit as well this is exactly a swing trading plan this is called the swing trading plan Lost Art again the

## <p>a New York strategy for Forex that is what we're going to talk about today we have already talked about a London strategy for Forex now we are going to talk about a New York strategy for Forex or indices I will make a separate video so the upcoming video is about enesis now the thing I want you to pay attention to in this video again we have two variables as I called it in the previous video for the London strategy there was an Asia expansion and an Asia consolidation variations today we are going to touch on a New York retracement and a New York reversal and the reason I want you to pay attention to it is because the New York retracement is the exact same thing as the Asia expansion and the New York reversal is the exact same thing as your Asia consolidation the only thing that changes is the time a lot of people think it's a whole different strategy you need to look at way other things no no no no you do the exact same thing the only thing that change is the time so in a funny way you can see that the mechanical steps that we use in this video are quite similar to the one in the London video alright so let's get into it so here on USD JPY what is the context if we move on to the monthly time frame here we have the monthly time frame and what we can see we are coming into an order block right there with an overlapping fair value Gap in the weekly forecast we mentioned this and the beauty of this monthly context is what because now on the weekly on The Daily on the four hour you already know where it is likely heading it's heading towards this height that is your opposing premium array so all this all that area on the lower time frame imagine how much price action that is your bias is set for the coming months having the monthly in context there is the easiest thing that we can have so we have that monthly order block on our chart and we know the monthly Target as well let's drop down into the the daily time frame alright so here we are on the daily and on The Daily you can see here we came into that monthly order blocker right there and this is our monthly Target so in between the monthly discount rate to the monthly premium array this area right there that is exactly where you want to get involved that is the highest probability price action right there that is the exact same as we mentioned on the previous London video where we go into the four hour you have your four hour context and you use a five minute entry and that is where you want to get evolved from the premium to the discount array it's as easy as that that is all the context you need it's important to understand when to trade so whenever we take out that high for example that is when you want to take a step back again again that can still be high probability but it's not as high probability as this price action right there and it's also the reason why a lot of people tend to get tricked when this right there happens when this huge down move happens a lot of people tend to get tricked because they're daily their weekly is not in context of their monthly time frame and on a monthly is just a continuation but on a daily time frame of course it might seem like we are very bearish right there but we're not and it's actually the opposite we are very bullish and there are high probability conditions for bullish prices right there where we can get involved so the thing I'm trying to tell you here I hope you can understand because the way you get to an entry pattern is the exact same way as you get to a bias because this exact thing when you move from monthly discount to monthly premium array that gives your bias on your weekly on your daily on your four hour when you then go into the weekly into the daily into the four hour discount arrays to premium arrays for example we have this right there this daily discount rate to that daily premium rate from that area to that area that is where you want to get involved it's all fractal it's all fractal you can make it as crazy as you want if you want to use one minute PD race with a one second entry pattern then you can do that but is it optimal no I would go up in time frames now if we go into that daily area right there the daily or block with the overlapping fair value Gap and go into the four hour here we are on the four hour and you can see the exact same context the same lines here we have the daily or block that Dave for Vega was right there the daily premium rate that is our Target and as well the monthly Target is also still sitting right there and on the four hour weekend notice if I zoom in a little we have this fair value Gap being created remember the St model that fair value Gap is already enough to trade off of just that singular fair value Gap so even on the four hour basis that could be your entry but again that's that's a whole other topic let's focus on the New York strategy and then right there if we zoom in and we go into that four hour fair value Gap and we go into the five minute time frame here we are on the five minute time frame and you can see this line on the left right there that is your daily order block with that overlapping daily for Vega that we saw and this gray area this gray box that is your four hour five value Gap can you notice something can you notice how fractal this is because the thing we saw on a daily Tire frame that I mentioned in the monthly context all the way at the beginning when we had a huge move down on the daily time frame the exact same thing we are seeing on a five minute here a lot of people tend to get spooked they tend to get overwhelmed because they don't understand the time frames above it and what is the context again it all started with the monthly so the monthly is bullish we're coming back into a daily order block into a daily fair value Gap the four hour creates an st model this fair value Gap if we are going higher where we likely going higher from that or our fair value Gap the only thing we need to do is in that four hour fair value Gap we need to look for a five minute entry pattern the exact same things we talked about in a London strategy video the only thing we need to do there is a look for an entry pattern that's all we need to do so you can see here that me giving it names so this would be a New York reversal why is it a New York reversal because a London law was right there it's around here London low was right there so London didn't make the low of today if London makes a low of the day and New York respects that low then you have a New York retracement this is a New York reversal how can we know that higher time for PD race your higher time for videos and again that can also be your 15 minute PD race if you are taking one minute entries that can also be your 15 minute PD rates but just make sure that 15-minute PD race are in contact with the one hour if you want to use one RPD race perfectly fine but just make sure the one RPD rays are in context of the four hour PD Rays because you have a 5 minute fare value Gap right there Why didn't it get respected well there's a four hour for Value Gap sitting right there just below it so this is all your liquidity so we come into a higher time for PD right here in New York that is important to understand and we come into it in New York then here we have our St model right there this could already be an entry but let's use the same premise that we used in a London video using overlapping PD Rays then right here you might not have gotten involved perfectly fine so what do we do we wait we wait for what we wait until we do have an opportunity so either it comes lower a bit lower until we reach that breaker block with the overlapping for Value Gap or we use this or block right there with that overlapping fair value Gap now what is our first Target well the first Target is intermediate term height intermediate term High aka the opposing premium Ray on a four hour basis which was this high right there now is this a very fruitful RR no it's not alright now can we cover this low right there well is the five minute right there in context of the 50 minute not just yet because we haven't taken a look at the 15 minute so if we take a look at the 15 minute we can see that the 50 minute came into that fair value Gap as well so the 50 minute also creates this swing low now again it's important to also look at to one hour so it's the 15 minute in context of the one hour the one hour didn't have any favorite gaps just yet so there's no reason for the one hour to retrace right there so what we did right there that's important to understand we had a checklist and we went over the checklist we went over our mechanical steps and we saw there's no reason for price to retrace so we can place our stop loss at that five minute load that we had right there so that is a perfectly fine stop loss placement now you can see the RR without suffocating the stop loss there's no reason to suffocate when I say suffocate you can Define suffocating by placing your stop loss at a place where price still has a reason to come back that is suffocating your stop loss there is the definition of suffocating your stop loss right now you can notice we already have a 2R just aiming for that high on a Monday on a Monday and if you're in a mentorship if you're in the money making team you know what I always tell people on a Monday Mondays are not there for you to aim for the moon they are there to build up your confidence or destroy your conference and the way you destroy your conference going into the week is by aiming for a ton of RR and taking losses and break evens all the time on a Monday that is setting yourself up for failure for the rest of the week Monday easy targets easy profit high probability trades to build up your confidence going into the rest of the week the Monday either makes you or breaks you so this is an example of New York reversal how did we know by knowing the higher time frame PD race and you can see the similarities because if I didn't mention to you that this was New York and if I mention to you that this was London then this would have been your Asia consolidation London variation it would have been the exact same there's there's literally no difference the only difference is that the time changes you might perceive it different but it's the same it's the exact same now let's take a look at New York retracement and we don't need to go that far because if we take a look at the same exact price action here on UC JPY on the four hour we still have the exact same context we have the monthly Target right there this is your daily order block this is your daily Target this is your four hour your value Gap right there then what do we notice then later on on Tuesday we have this for our fair value Gap sitting right there and now let's go into the five minute time frame again right here we noticed that London right there is coming into that higher time for PD Ray already and London already had what a displacement higher what is the displacement again defined it's a fair value Gap so the difference between the example we just saw and this example is what London in the previous example didn't come into an higher time from pdre that was in alignment with our targets Etc and with our context here it did do that so what do you you do again can you take out this London low yes it can of course it can who am I to tell price it can't right of course it can but what do you do what are the steps again in New York you now wait for a bullish fair value Gap higher where is your bullish program in New York New York starts right here on that candle this right there is your first bullish fair value Gap so that right there could already be your entry or even higher right there which low do you cover you cover this low right there that is your intermediate term low in New York and again what are your targets your targets are that height that is your four hour opposing premium array AKA your intermediate term high right there and of course you can tell again that the RR is not that great so what do you do on a Tuesday you can potentially aim for more but what you can also do is refine your engine because as you can notice we are not entering on overlapping PD Ray right there so either we have to have a little bit more patience and we enter off of that order block where we also have that for Value Gap and we covered that a low and that already increases your RR to two just make sure that you have a set entry pattern that you can always rely on and you repeat day in and day out you don't change it if you change it then there will be confusion because when you get to that entry pattern and you need to actually enter and you don't have a set entry pattern you will confuse the absolute living out of yourself and the emotions will start to rise and you will think oh do I need to enter on this or block do I need to enter on this fair value Gap it's destined to fill it it's ineftable you're going to mess up and the beautiful thing that you now might have noticed what is this this is the exact same as Asia expansion we just called New York retracement why because it's in New York but nothing changes the only thing that changes is the time it's it's truly a beautiful thing it's all fractal and once you notice this the fractality of everything that we mentioned it's absolutely beautiful and I'll mention it again your new week opening app your Reaper fair value Gap your AMD your power three even your Market maker model which we'll go over into later as well don't worry your silver bullet F re thing you can think of is already in this trading plan alright on that note I am back from vacation so thank you all for your patience we will be having our weekly forecast again this Sunday I'm very excited to talk with you all so this Sunday 8 30 again coming weeks as well 8 30 live stream right here on YouTube so the time has come if you haven't watched that London video just yet please do watch it and if you have watched it go watch it again because now you can see it's basically the exact same thing the only thing that changed is the time right here on your screen you can tap the video and you can watch it alright perfect thank you foreign [Music]</p>

daily for Vega that we saw and this gray area this gray box that is your four hour five value Gap can you notice something can you notice how fractal this is because the thing we saw on a daily Tire frame that I mentioned in the monthly context all the way at the beginning when we had a huge move down on the daily time frame the exact same thing we are seeing on a five minute here a lot of people tend to get spooked they tend to get overwhelmed because they don't understand the time frames above it and what is the context again it all started with the monthly so the monthly is bullish we're coming back into a daily order block into a daily fair value Gap the four hour creates an st model this fair value Gap if we are going higher where we likely going higher from that or our fair value Gap the only thing we need to do is in that four hour fair value Gap we need to look for a five minute entry pattern the exact same things we talked about in a London strategy video the only thing we need to do there is a look for an entry pattern that's all we need to do so you can see here that me giving it names so this would be a New York reversal why is it a New York reversal because a London law was right there it's around here London low was right there so London didn't make the low of today if London makes a low of the day and New York respects that low then you have a New York retracement this is a New York reversal how can we know that higher time for PD race your higher time for videos and again that can also be your 15 minute PD race if you are taking one minute entries that can also be your 15 minute PD rates but just make sure that 15-minute PD race are in contact with the one hour if you want to use one RPD race perfectly fine but just make sure the one RPD rays are in context of the four hour PD Rays because you have a 5 minute fare value Gap right there Why didn't it get respected well there's a four hour for Value Gap sitting right there just below it so this is all your liquidity so we come into a higher time for PD right here in New York that is important to understand and we come into it in New York then here we have our St model right there this could already be an entry but let's use the same premise that we used in a London video using overlapping PD Rays then right here you might not have gotten involved perfectly fine so what do we do we wait we wait for what we wait until we do have an opportunity so either it comes lower a bit lower until we reach that breaker block with the overlapping for Value Gap or we use this or block right there with that overlapping fair value Gap now what is our first Target well the first Target is intermediate term height intermediate term High aka the opposing premium Ray on a four hour basis which was this high right there now is this a very fruitful RR no it's not alright now can we cover this low right there well is the five minute right there in context of the 50 minute not just yet because we haven't taken a look at the 15 minute so if we take a look at the 15 minute we can see that the 50 minute came into that fair value Gap as well so the 50 minute also creates this swing low now again it's important to also look at to one hour so it's the 15 minute in context of the one hour the one hour didn't have any favorite gaps just yet so there's no reason for the one hour to retrace right there so what we did right there that's important to understand we had a checklist and we went over the checklist we went over our mechanical steps and we saw there's no reason for price to retrace so we can place our stop loss at that five minute load that we had right there so that is a perfectly fine stop loss placement now you can see the RR without suffocating the stop loss there's no reason to suffocate when I say suffocate you can Define suffocating by placing your stop loss at a place where price still has a reason to come back that is suffocating your stop loss there is the definition of suffocating your stop loss right now you can notice we already have a 2R just aiming for that high on a Monday on a Monday and if you're in a mentorship if you're in the money making team you know what I always tell people on a Monday Mondays are not there for you to aim for the moon they are there to build up your confidence or destroy your conference and the way you destroy your conference going into the week is by aiming for a ton of RR and taking losses and break evens all the time on a Monday that is setting yourself up for failure for the rest of the week Monday easy targets easy profit high probability trades to build up your confidence going into the rest of the week the Monday either makes you or breaks you so this is an example of New York reversal how did we know by knowing the higher time frame PD race and you can see the similarities because if I didn't mention to you that this was New York and if I mention to you that this was London then this would have been your Asia consolidation London variation it would have been the exact same there's there's literally no difference the only difference is that the time changes you might perceive it different but it's the same it's the exact same now let's take a look at New York retracement and we don't need to go that far because if we take a look at the same exact price action here on UC JPY on the four hour we still have the exact same context we have the monthly Target right there this is your daily order block this is your daily Target this is your four hour your value Gap right there then what do we notice then later on on Tuesday we have this for our fair value Gap sitting right there and now let's go into the five minute time frame again right here we noticed that London right there is coming into that higher time for PD Ray already and London already had what a displacement higher what is the displacement again defined it's a fair value Gap so the difference between the example we just saw and this example is what London in the previous example didn't come into an higher time from pdre that was in alignment with our targets Etc and with our context here it did do that so what do you you do again can you take out this London low yes it can of course it can who am I to tell price it can't right of course it can but what do you do what are the steps again in New York you now wait for a bullish fair value Gap higher where is your bullish program in New York New York starts right here on that candle this right there is your first bullish fair value Gap so that right there could already be your entry or even higher right there which low do you cover you cover this low right there that is your intermediate term low in New York and again what are your targets your targets are that height that is your four hour opposing premium array AKA your intermediate term high right there and of course you can tell again that the RR is not that great so what do you do on a Tuesday you can potentially aim for more but what you can also do is refine your engine because as you can notice we are not entering on overlapping PD Ray right there so either we have to have a little bit more patience and we enter off of that order block where we also have that for Value Gap and we covered that a low and that already increases your RR to two just make sure that you have a set entry pattern that you can always rely on and you repeat day in and day out you don't change it if you change it then there will be confusion because when you get to that entry pattern and you need to actually enter and you don't have a set entry pattern you will confuse the absolute living out of yourself and the emotions will start to rise and you will think oh do I need to enter on this or block do I need to enter on this fair value Gap it's destined to fill it it's ineftable you're going to mess up and the beautiful thing that you now might have noticed what is this this is the exact same as Asia expansion we just called New York retracement why because it's in New York but nothing changes the only thing that changes is the time it's it's truly a beautiful thing it's all fractal and once you notice this the fractality of everything that we mentioned it's absolutely beautiful and I'll mention it again your new week opening app your Reaper fair value Gap your AMD your power three even your Market maker model which we'll go over into later as well don't worry your silver bullet F re thing you can think of is already in this trading plan alright on that note I am back from vacation so thank you all for your patience we will be having our weekly forecast again this Sunday I'm very excited to talk with you all so this Sunday 8 30 again coming weeks as well 8 30 live stream right here on YouTube so the time has come if you haven't watched that London video just yet please do watch it and if you have watched it go watch it again because now you can see it's basically the exact same thing the only thing that changed is the time right here on your screen you can tap the video and you can watch it alright perfect thank you foreign [Music]

## <p>a Judas Wing what is a duty swing AKA a fake out how can we see them coming those are exactly the things I'm going to be touching on in this video so the way I always like to explain Judah swing Judah swing is the fake move before the real move aka the fake out before the real move happens now back in the day I used to actually fall for these fake outs and used to get trapped in these Judo swings and the main reason why is because I was trapped on the lower time frame I was only looking at the lower time frame I was not zoomed out I was not seeing the bigger picture I saw the Judas ring and I was like oh I need to get in I need to get in and that happened a lot of times for example right here back in the day I would see this and I would be like oh I need to get in right here I need to get in because this is obviously going higher and I was neglecting the higher time frame here and the Judah swing AKA a fake out is so well designed I'm pretty certain I was not the only one falling for this because this is exactly the reason why it is a judo swing it is to trick people into the market and right here what you'll see if we zoom out on the four hour we see that this Judas Wing was just a move back into this four hour Fairfax to then continue lower to finish the objective of reaching that low eventually and if you're only looking at the lower time frame you will not see this objective you will be lost on the lower time frame and that is exactly why this Judo swing is so dangerous so a judo swing how can we recognize a judo swing and how can we potentially trade them or what do these fake outs look like and what are they actually reaching for so first it is important to understand stand before every session we have a judo swing when a session just starts at the beginning of London for example you will have a fake move first before you get the real move then ahead of the day ahead of the daily range forming like we talked about in a daily profiles you will have a fake move first which is generally London and then you get the real expansion for that day then a fake move before the weekly expansion which we also talked about in the weekly profiles and in the previous power 3 episode fake move before the weekly expansion is usually on a Monday Tuesday and sometimes a Wednesday and then also what we touched on the previous episode the fake move before a monthly expansion these are all Judas swings AKA a fake out before the real move happens in other words as well it is the manipulation part of that power 3 that we touched on the previous episode so if we go over sessions first the first thing we saw right here what actually happened when we came into that for Alpha fire gap right there at this time New York session started can you see what New York is doing first a fake move and then you have to real move and this happens all the time if we look at London for example we keep in mind this higher time from objective of going lower and reaching that low right there if we now go into London right here what do we see London starts around this time London actually pushes lower first and then what it has a fake move and then continues lower on the lower time frame on the one minute time frame because I know a lot of people will be looking at that on a one minute time frame and they will see oh we just had liquidity sweep right there and we are now continuing higher but remember the same every time frame needs to be in context of the time frame above it just because the one minute switched here doesn't mean we will now see higher prices because if we again zoom out to the 15 minute time frame what do we see using the flood and the lot concept what is the plot first line of defense right there what is the last line of defense right there so whenever you expect a Judas swing whenever you expect a fake out like this aka the fake move before we get to real move this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say wait for that retracement first when you have that retracement you want to get involved here to write that expansion so that Judas swing see it as your friend it is what we need to get involved and what can it then reach into it can reach into the plot and the lot so right here we have the lot and the flood right there in that lack that is exactly what it will reach into it either reaches into the flood which is most of the time a fair value Gap if we have a fair value Gap in the lag then it will likely not reach into the lot in other words it will not sweep that high and continue lower if we have a fair value Gap in the leg so right here this exactly this is your Judo swing before we get the real move right there and if you now look into New York session what do we see we see New York session also has this fake move right here continuing lower Earth and then it expands higher reaching into what into this rare value Gap with an overlapping mitigation block right there using again the flood and the lot what is your flawed right there what is your lot right there it shouldn't come back below this low it should not sweep this low so a Judas swing will either take out liquidity or will reach into a fair value Gap if there is a fair value Gap in the lag it will likely not reach for that liquidity and it will respect the fair value you get so a judo swing yes we can expect a fake move but it is unlogical to expect a move all the way like this and then continue higher that's what I actually used to First expect with a judo swing at first I thought alright somebody told me a Judy swing is a fake move before a real move so what I expected I was expecting unlogical things for a due to swing and what I mean by that is I was expecting the Judo swing to sweep all this liquidity and then continue higher in the same session now why is that unreasonable we only have so much volatility throughout the day if price on EU usually moves I don't know 80 Pips on average every day then can we expect a 40 pip move lower an 80 pip move higher in the same exact session no so a judo swing will retrace back into what I created right there your verify gaps or liquidity pool a fake move into that and then it will continue higher so where can we get involved we want to get involved in that Judo swing we want to get involved here we want to get involved there to write the expansion that is exactly what we want so this is the New York session and this is the London session both having a Judas swing right there but if we now zoom out onto the daily or at least the daily expansion what do we see what did we just talk about we talked about a fake move before the daily expansion AKA our daily profile London right here create the love today and New York expense what is this in your power 3 that is your manipulation even more detailed even more zoomed in this is your Judas swing that is your fake out this exactly this is your fake out before the real move happens so when we are moving lower like this in London the thing you need to ask yourself is are we going lower to go lower or are we going lower to go higher in other words am I trading a Judah swing here or am I already trading the expansion that is very important and having those higher time from PD race the things we can reach for having those on your time frame will benefit you a lot to not get blindsided by these type of conditions because if I didn't have this line on my chart that high time frame line to the left I removed it on the lower time frame right here and this is exactly what happened to me back in the day on the lower time frame right here I would see alright we are continuing lower clear structure continue lower and then all of a sudden we would have this big expansion higher and I would just be blindsided I would have no idea what just went wrong whilst the solution is very simple having that higher time frame drawn liquidity right there on your chart and seeing all right this is a Friday so according to the weekly profile that we touched on as well let's thank God as Friday setup is not unreasonable right here we all of a sudden start rejecting back above that line back above that liquidity pool so right here we now can react and we can say oh all right that might have been a Juda swing and now we are in for the real expansion for that day now why did I go for this low right here well if you move out to the Daily and this is getting back to the basics essentially of what we touched on because this when we are coming from this premium array right there if we are in this premium rate what is the first discount array that we cannot reach for it it is this swing low right right there so that right there once all this starts to align that exactly that is your Target and every time again you will see some form of a judo swing some form of fake move before you get the real move because again if we look at the four hour what did we see here we had Monday right here here we can see Monday starts here right here so the beginning of the week starts here and what can we see we can see we first have a fake move right there and then we have the real move so at the beginning of the week just like we saw at the beginning of the day we have that fake move first and then we have the real move and if we zoom out on the daily right here what do we see this is the start of June right there this candle what do we see we first have a down move and then the real move starts so again a fake move before the real move that fake move that is where we want to get involved and this would be your Judas swing on a monthly basis so referring to the monthly candle here and this is what we talked about on the previous episode that is exactly where you will see that manipulation that Judas swing is your manipulation so if you watched multiple videos can you see now how much sense this is making how this is completely working in harmony with each other that is exactly the reason why I'm making a series in the first place if you're only watching this one video then I would highly suggest you to watch the full A to Z because you will absolutely love it and it will make a lot a lot of sense so if we now drop back down into the 50 minutes and look for a few more Judas swings right here for example what do we see here we already expand in Asia and then right here we have some kind of Judah swing but a London already expands and the most important thing to understand right here is that we already have this verify Gap so on the 15 minute it is actually very simple what you would do here ahead of trading this London session you would say all right we are now floating around here on this leg on the most recent lag what can we reach into well we have this flood that far very Gap we could reach into the order block but I think this will do the job I don't think we will reach into that if we do want to go go higher we will not disrespect that low the Judo swing starts to happen right here and then London already accelerates higher so why does London already accelerate higher and why does it not give the Judah swing right there at the beginning of the session but we already reached into that right there and then at the start of London we had a little sting into that February Gap and then we expanded higher that is more than enough this is already where we can get involved and this is also how you can know if there will be another Judo swing or if the session will just accelerate because here it had a sting into it and then it accelerates because it is already in that discount array so whenever you expect a move expect a fake move first a fake move always happens first before we get the real move this fake move is your Judas swing and if you attend the live streams you'll hear me say this so many times you want to get involved in the retracements not in the expansion so what I mean by that is right here you can see we are taking that high and we have already expanded these up candles that is an expansion that is not where you want to get involved you want to get involved in this retracement or this retracement and then you want to write the expansion you don't want to chase the expansion you want to chase the retracement in a sense get involved in the retracement aka the Judas swing and then you want to write the expansion so again a fake move always happens first before we get the real move this fake move is your Judas swing that fake move is trying to play with your emotions because you will think at first oh this is pretty scary it's coming down and yes that's exactly what we need we needed to come down first before we can get involved at first it will be scary seeing these things in life it will be very scary but you need to learn to trust that higher timeframe objective and see it play out time and time again doing markups Etc so here we are on ES on the e-mini SMP Futures Contract and we can see we had this move higher off of this daily fair value Gap just simply using the flood and the lot what is the first line of defense first line of defense was actually this but it's very high in premium then we have this fair value Gap if we are going higher where we likely going higher from this daily provide Gap and on a weekly that is the most important we also had that Weekly verify Gap right there that is the most important thing to understand so this this was all called in the weekly forecast we all saw this coming if you are attending the live streams we all saw this coming and that's exactly what we touched on in the weekly forecast on the live streams on Sunday so right here once we reach this what will we now likely reach for we will reach for that right there that is already your drone liquidity the important thing you need to understand is I am giving you a drone liquidity here because if you know where it is going higher from you already have your drone liquidity you don't need to worry what it's heading towards the only thing you truly need to worry about is if we are going higher where are we going higher from because that is where you want to get involved you don't want to get involved once we reach that drone liquidity you want to get involved once we are moving higher and starting to move higher that is exactly why I teach if we are going higher where are we likely going higher because if you can get involved there then the Drone liquidity doesn't really matter you can just write the expansion this drawing liquidity is all fun and games but it's the second step the first step is knowing where we will likely go higher from Once you can know that you can make millions I'm not even joking you can make millions because here all you need to do is look for an entry pattern get involved right there and this draw on liquidity is not that important it's not that important because in the meantime when we already read that you have already made a ton of profit all you need to know in a bullish trend if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from that's all you need to know and that automatically leads you to your drama quality so there was a little touch on drone liquipity once we have that context first here that is very important then now we can go into the lower time frame and see those Judas swings in play so I think this is beautiful if I now Mark out the beginning of the week that is the beginning of the week then at certain moments in time and this is why yes and NASDAQ especially and Futures in general they are so beautiful for Judith swing if you are trading Futures it's the same on Forex but Forex is a little bit less volatile so it it doesn't move that aggressive as es and NASDAQ especially during the equities open and this is why I said it's very important to watch both the indices skills on the video and the Forex skills on video because right here you can see the difference right here can you see how beautiful yes has a judo swing at certain times of day whenever there's equities open 9 30 and just before that at 8 30 you will clearly see a judo swing right here due to swing big move before the real move write that fake move before the real move sweeping what that high right there that high perfect beautiful absolutely beautiful price action but Argo you just said if there is a fair value Gap in the lag lower it will likely not get swept this is where time comes in because right here when we see this happening and we sweep that low that is exactly where you need to react and need to be able to adapt that is very important that is a great characteristic of equities open of the indices where we sweep a high or low and then continue lower exactly what we touched on in the daily profiles as well and I say that is where time comes in because when this happens when this huge move happens there likely won't be an entry pattern on the lower time frame right there the only thing you will see is a big expansion higher and now you're either thinking if we actually go into the five minute right there there's two ways of looking at this right there's two ways ways of looking at it at first people will see this big expansion higher and they will say oh yeah this is the real move we are heading higher we are definitely continuing higher and that is not unreasonable to think why not because we are coming off of a daily Gap but this is a Monday and the reason and I actually caught this as well in a mentorship I said this day price wants to jump higher but it can't why gonna jump higher why doesn't it go higher on this day there was no energy to do it there was no economic calendar to do it there was no economic calendar event supporting that idea on that particular day that is why you'll see Tuesday moving higher that's exactly what we mentioned so right here once we move higher there are a few people saying all right this is the real move I want to get in here and they will get absolutely burned they will take stop loss after stop loss after stop loss and they will be left questioning why didn't it work well based off of the Judo swing here we can clearly see this is moving higher very aggressively yes correct it is reaching above a liquidity pool right there and then right here that is where you have the real move and where you want to get involved so if you saw this fake move coming before the real move you might have asked yourself the question are we going higher to go lower or are we going higher to continue higher and then a lot of questions start to pop up right what day is it it is a Monday we have no economic calendar news event all right I I don't think we are heading higher just yet and that is exactly when you'll see this so to give you a better example what happens here on this Tuesday right there the fake move before the real move that is exactly that fair value Gap is what you can look for now what does it do again it reaches for a liquidity pool and a verify Gap in this case and then it continues higher then right here on Wednesday what do we see again the same thing we have the fake move before the real move right there and what does it reach into well it reaches into something beautiful why something beautiful it reaches into that breaker with that fair value Gap right there with this liquidity but the most important thing is if we look at this from a one hour standpoint right there we can see it reaches into fair value Gap in that lag using the flood and the lot method into that breaker right there and then continues higher right here we have on Thursday we have another duty swing what does it reach into liquidity pool right there intermediate term low intermediate term high once we take the intermediom high we can expect a bigger retracement boom there it happens and we continue higher that is your Judas swing and that is absolutely beautiful tradable right here on ES and NASDAQ Etc using the method of every time frame needs to be in context of the time frame above it because then you will not get faked out by this and then understanding are we going lower to go higher eventually or are we going lower to continue lower this is all crucial to understand if you can understand this you have made a major step in your trading alright perfect thank you [Music]

real move so at the beginning of the week just like we saw at the beginning of the day we have that fake move first and then we have the real move and if we zoom out on the daily right here what do we see this is the start of June right there this candle what do we see we first have a down move and then the real move starts so again a fake move before the real move that fake move that is where we want to get involved and this would be your Judas swing on a monthly basis so referring to the monthly candle here and this is what we talked about on the previous episode that is exactly where you will see that manipulation that Judas swing is your manipulation so if you watched multiple videos can you see now how much sense this is making how this is completely working in harmony with each other that is exactly the reason why I'm making a series in the first place if you're only watching this one video then I would highly suggest you to watch the full A to Z because you will absolutely love it and it will make a lot a lot of sense so if we now drop back down into the 50 minutes and look for a few more Judas swings right here for example what do we see here we already expand in Asia and then right here we have some kind of Judah swing but a London already expands and the most important thing to understand right here is that we already have this verify Gap so on the 15 minute it is actually very simple what you would do here ahead of trading this London session you would say all right we are now floating around here on this leg on the most recent lag what can we reach into well we have this flood that far very Gap we could reach into the order block but I think this will do the job I don't think we will reach into that if we do want to go go higher we will not disrespect that low the Judo swing starts to happen right here and then London already accelerates higher so why does London already accelerate higher and why does it not give the Judah swing right there at the beginning of the session but we already reached into that right there and then at the start of London we had a little sting into that February Gap and then we expanded higher that is more than enough this is already where we can get involved and this is also how you can know if there will be another Judo swing or if the session will just accelerate because here it had a sting into it and then it accelerates because it is already in that discount array so whenever you expect a move expect a fake move first a fake move always happens first before we get the real move this fake move is your Judas swing and if you attend the live streams you'll hear me say this so many times you want to get involved in the retracements not in the expansion so what I mean by that is right here you can see we are taking that high and we have already expanded these up candles that is an expansion that is not where you want to get involved you want to get involved in this retracement or this retracement and then you want to write the expansion you don't want to chase the expansion you want to chase the retracement in a sense get involved in the retracement aka the Judas swing and then you want to write the expansion so again a fake move always happens first before we get the real move this fake move is your Judas swing that fake move is trying to play with your emotions because you will think at first oh this is pretty scary it's coming down and yes that's exactly what we need we needed to come down first before we can get involved at first it will be scary seeing these things in life it will be very scary but you need to learn to trust that higher timeframe objective and see it play out time and time again doing markups Etc so here we are on ES on the e-mini SMP Futures Contract and we can see we had this move higher off of this daily fair value Gap just simply using the flood and the lot what is the first line of defense first line of defense was actually this but it's very high in premium then we have this fair value Gap if we are going higher where we likely going higher from this daily provide Gap and on a weekly that is the most important we also had that Weekly verify Gap right there that is the most important thing to understand so this this was all called in the weekly forecast we all saw this coming if you are attending the live streams we all saw this coming and that's exactly what we touched on in the weekly forecast on the live streams on Sunday so right here once we reach this what will we now likely reach for we will reach for that right there that is already your drone liquidity the important thing you need to understand is I am giving you a drone liquidity here because if you know where it is going higher from you already have your drone liquidity you don't need to worry what it's heading towards the only thing you truly need to worry about is if we are going higher where are we going higher from because that is where you want to get involved you don't want to get involved once we reach that drone liquidity you want to get involved once we are moving higher and starting to move higher that is exactly why I teach if we are going higher where are we likely going higher because if you can get involved there then the Drone liquidity doesn't really matter you can just write the expansion this drawing liquidity is all fun and games but it's the second step the first step is knowing where we will likely go higher from Once you can know that you can make millions I'm not even joking you can make millions because here all you need to do is look for an entry pattern get involved right there and this draw on liquidity is not that important it's not that important because in the meantime when we already read that you have already made a ton of profit all you need to know in a bullish trend if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from that's all you need to know and that automatically leads you to your drama quality so there was a little touch on drone liquipity once we have that context first here that is very important then now we can go into the lower time frame and see those Judas swings in play so I think this is beautiful if I now Mark out the beginning of the week that is the beginning of the week then at certain moments in time and this is why yes and NASDAQ especially and Futures in general they are so beautiful for Judith swing if you are trading Futures it's the same on Forex but Forex is a little bit less volatile so it it doesn't move that aggressive as es and NASDAQ especially during the equities open and this is why I said it's very important to watch both the indices skills on the video and the Forex skills on video because right here you can see the difference right here can you see how beautiful yes has a judo swing at certain times of day whenever there's equities open 9 30 and just before that at 8 30 you will clearly see a judo swing right here due to swing big move before the real move write that fake move before the real move sweeping what that high right there that high perfect beautiful absolutely beautiful price action but Argo you just said if there is a fair value Gap in the lag lower it will likely not get swept this is where time comes in because right here when we see this happening and we sweep that low that is exactly where you need to react and need to be able to adapt that is very important that is a great characteristic of equities open of the indices where we sweep a high or low and then continue lower exactly what we touched on in the daily profiles as well and I say that is where time comes in because when this happens when this huge move happens there likely won't be an entry pattern on the lower time frame right there the only thing you will see is a big expansion higher and now you're either thinking if we actually go into the five minute right there there's two ways of looking at this right there's two ways ways of looking at it at first people will see this big expansion higher and they will say oh yeah this is the real move we are heading higher we are definitely continuing higher and that is not unreasonable to think why not because we are coming off of a daily Gap but this is a Monday and the reason and I actually caught this as well in a mentorship I said this day price wants to jump higher but it can't why gonna jump higher why doesn't it go higher on this day there was no energy to do it there was no economic calendar to do it there was no economic calendar event supporting that idea on that particular day that is why you'll see Tuesday moving higher that's exactly what we mentioned so right here once we move higher there are a few people saying all right this is the real move I want to get in here and they will get absolutely burned they will take stop loss after stop loss after stop loss and they will be left questioning why didn't it work well based off of the Judo swing here we can clearly see this is moving higher very aggressively yes correct it is reaching above a liquidity pool right there and then right here that is where you have the real move and where you want to get involved so if you saw this fake move coming before the real move you might have asked yourself the question are we going higher to go lower or are we going higher to continue higher and then a lot of questions start to pop up right what day is it it is a Monday we have no economic calendar news event all right I I don't think we are heading higher just yet and that is exactly when you'll see this so to give you a better example what happens here on this Tuesday right there the fake move before the real move that is exactly that fair value Gap is what you can look for now what does it do again it reaches for a liquidity pool and a verify Gap in this case and then it continues higher then right here on Wednesday what do we see again the same thing we have the fake move before the real move right there and what does it reach into well it reaches into something beautiful why something beautiful it reaches into that breaker with that fair value Gap right there with this liquidity but the most important thing is if we look at this from a one hour standpoint right there we can see it reaches into fair value Gap in that lag using the flood and the lot method into that breaker right there and then continues higher right here we have on Thursday we have another duty swing what does it reach into liquidity pool right there intermediate term low intermediate term high once we take the intermediom high we can expect a bigger retracement boom there it happens and we continue higher that is your Judas swing and that is absolutely beautiful tradable right here on ES and NASDAQ Etc using the method of every time frame needs to be in context of the time frame above it because then you will not get faked out by this and then understanding are we going lower to go higher eventually or are we going lower to continue lower this is all crucial to understand if you can understand this you have made a major step in your trading alright perfect thank you [Music] thank you [Music]

## <p>the trading industry has been lying to you about a lot of things including sculpting now in this video I need you to understand I'm going to keep it very real and I'll try my best to expose all the lies and of course I will also show you how to do it instead I also need you to understand that I'm talking from experience here I've seen it all I've done it all before I want you to learn from my experience so you don't have to make the same mistakes that I did this will be a full scalping guide now first off I want to go over what not to do and then afterwards I want to go over what you should be doing both parts are really important now the way people approach sculpting nowadays they go into the market and they just let them guide by their intuition so they're fully in their emotions and they go into the one minute and they say all right we have one fair value lower right there with small forever low right there so that should eventually go lower as well right and it takes stop loss after stop loss after stop loss after stop loss because they don't understand how to scope yes you are indeed scalping when you take a trade off of one of these verified gaps right here because you're getting in quick and you're getting out quick but if you're just taking trade by diving into the one minute and taking a trade off of every one minute pair of value Gap and you're letting the one minute guide you then ask yourself is that truly beneficial for you are you truly benefiting off of that and be honest with yourself because I don't think you are a lot of people are sculpting because they think scalping is more traits equals more money the people that make the most money in this industry they don't sculpt they let the capital do the heavy lifting for them now again I'm not trying to discourage you because if you truly like scoping and you're very good at it perfect do it but usually people are sculpting for the wrong reasons nowadays it's a trend to scalp and humans are just Trend followers and I don't mean Trend followers is in the mark is going higher or lower no they follow the trend as in this human is doing that so I guess I will also do that they just follow the masses let me tell you the masses are extremely unsuccessful most of them so what this whole Channel what this whole YouTube channel is also about we are not trying to do the same things that other people are doing because clearly that isn't working we are focused on making money very important again why do people usually sculpt because they think you work harder because you have more opportunities potentially if you're using the one minute then of course there's going to be opportunities everywhere and then they think because you have more opportunity so you must make more money right let me tell you working harder in trading does not equate to making more money it's the opposite World in trading less is more in trading that's just a general rule of thumb to go by when you're doing something always remember less is more in trading especially in trading in trading you need to understand you will not get reward wired by someone that is higher up than you that will tell you why you worked so hard today maybe you lost a lot of money but you worked really hard great job no you need to understand here it's less is more so working harder in trading does not equate to making more money and again with working harder I'm aiming at trying to find the most opportunities during one single trading day that is absolutely detrimental then I also need you to understand that sculpting is very fancy or all the reasons I just stated it's very quick action it's like you can compare to tick tock and YouTube YouTube You'll likely learn the most but it's not the most fancy right tick tock where you have a five second video you'll likely not learn that much but it is very fancy so again if you want to be a scalper you need to be a scalper for the right reasons that is very important if your scalper just mainly because everyone does it or the bigger reason and people think sculpting makes the most money which is absolutely the furthest thing from the the truth it's garbage it's not true and usually that is why people get into sculpting now it's funny because I have a sculpting guide here and I'm absolutely annihilating sculpting here but I need you to understand that the reasons you are sculpting need to be absolutely correct because a lot of people are just going into the one minute time frame and they take every one minute fair value Gap without any reason behind it and it tried to argue with the point yeah but I don't need a daily bias do you really not need daily bias again if you're trying to follow some algorithm and you know the algorithm is mainly controlled by orders on the higher time frame so that has four hour daily weekly and monthly then who are you really fooling you're fooling yourself by saying that you don't need a daily bias because you do and if you truly are convinced that you don't need a daily bias then I would ask yourself are you truly benefiting off of the fact that you're not using a daily bias or are you just being lazy and you don't want to put in the work because most of the time it's the latter where people are just lazy and they don't want to put in the work because it's too difficult you yes of course it's difficult you thought it was going to be easy you start being rich and having freedom in this world was going to be easy of course not that's what makes it fun the reward is so fun because it takes effort death feeling is so fulfilling so that is very important to understand then how can we sculpt first off we need to understand some kind of daily bias now the daily bias I'm going to be using as you may have already seen is the exact same one in the previous video so in the previous video we went over daily bias if you've not seen that just yet finish this video and afterwards watch that daily bias video it's the previous A to Z guide episode where we mentioned alright this fair value Gap is not strong right it's not a strong Verger right there then this fair value Gap is likely a strong perfect Gap because if this is not pushing price higher the FFL Gap then what will push price lower this premium rate in form of Death Valley Gap in between those fair value gaps all you're doing is your finding the high probability price action so you're looking at the stronger fair value gaps which fair value is stronger here this fair value Gap is weaker than that for Vega so this is the stronger fair value right what you're doing between this fair value Gap and that next Target right there you're letting the one hour guide you the one hour is your guide to your next Target so constantly you're letting the one hour guide in that one hour price action is what I will show you you're taking either one minute entries or five minute entries now to show you why you still need context and why you still need to be able to read price action on the higher time frame if we dive into this piece of price action right there on the one hour so here we are here we have the weak daily forever Gap and we have the strong daily for five Gap sitting right there as well then this price action what you would be doing you would be looking at structure based on the one hour so now you would be using time to your advantage and ideally as well news but there is an extract Confluence the video we talked about how you can use the news drivers to know which they will expand Etc that is an extra Confluence so time into a PD array and there you look for your confirmation now if we have a weak fair value Gap and we don't have clear context right there because this is a weak fair value Gap they're not really bullish we're not really bearish then what is happening we take this order block when we dive into the one minute what will you see you'll see here that when coming into that discount rate that order block on the one hour that we will take a lot of losses right there why because the context is not supporting the ID that is why when you're just taking random one minute verify gaps everywhere that will not be sustainable on the long term why not let me tell you if we zoom out back onto the one hour time frame what will we see we will see that high probability price action for example when coming off of this strong daily feather Gap right there this pushes price lower in a very short amount of time in what is it one day and 16 hours this verify Gap right there did what it took about five days and 18 hours to push price higher low probability conditions will last way longer than high probability conditions so for sculpting it is very important to also identify the high probability conditions especially when you're on the lower time frame like the one minute because on the one minute you can extremely easily blow an account because there's always a reason to justify a trade ID on the one minute the entries will all look the same what is difference between one one minute for Value Gap and the other one minute fair value Gap it's what happened before that it's the boundary that needs to get hit first and then we have the one-man February Gap that is where you want to enter so let me show you what I mean with that if we have no boundary like I just mentioned and we go into the one minute time frame then we can take every one minute fare value Gap as an entry does that mean it's a good entry absolutely not what is the boundary that happens before that that is what differentiates a week one minute traffic from a strong one minute there needs to be a boundary before that the boundary is a one hour PD array or a 15 minute PD array again when coming off of ideally a daily fair value Gap or a daily PD array so first off you need to have the daily somewhat agreeing to your idea to go into the one hour because what we just saw is that if we have the one hour agreeing right here but we don't have the daily agreeing so right here we have the one hour agreeing going higher but we don't really have the daily agreeing not really a strong for Vega then we will take a lot of hit before we get the right move and that is very dangerous in sculpting because in sculpting like in the industry they show you all the wins but if we took every one minute verify Gap that was sitting right here we would have taken 10 hits before we get a win and that one win yes we can brag about it on Instagram on Twitter whatever and that's usually what people to do but they don't tell you or they forget to tell you quote unquote forget about the 10 losses that they took because they were identical when you have one minutes verify gaps that are identical which one are you taking you need somewhat of a guideline right there and the guideline is whatever happens before that so A one hour PD Ray in context of your daily bias again remember the daily bias respecting and disrespecting Etc we established on a daily time frame here a week for flag up strong fair value Gap respect because we are wicking next Target could be that daily discount array in the form of that swing low right there so that is our context in between that high and that low right there that is where we want to get involved ideally because we have high probability price action right there then if we go into the one hour we need the one hour to show fair value gaps lower to agree with the ID of going lower indeed right here this is the next day we have a new fair value Gap so first we respected that for Vi Gap based on the daily time frame now we have a new day right there showing a new bearish fair value Gap inside that provide Gap that is your one hour PD Ray that you will use to go into the one minute to now scalp now the reason I say you can also use the five minutes usually what people think is going into the one minute means that you are sculpting or going into the second time frame Etc what if I tell you you can make it easier for yourself and the five minute you can achieve the exact same entry as you would have taken on the one minute maybe even a better entry but the five minute usually isn't fancy enough for people the five minute you can achieve the exact same entries and it would still be scoping let me show you what I mean with that if we dive into the one minute on that one hour fare value Gap right there then once we are here what do you want to do you want to wait for your St and then you want to wait for your new February leg up lower which once we have an SD right here then we have a new verify Gap lower right there as well that is where you can place your entry on the overlapping part with those lows there as well and you cover what do you cover the intermediate term high that is right there what do you target well since you are sculpting you have a close Target you get in you get out so ideally at first a one to two a one to two is perfectly fine to Target at first so somewhere around they're perfectly fine and again you don't need to do this right because you could have also very well done a real scalp where you now enter off of this overlapping part because that is also already valid you cover the fair value Gap and you charge a one two two a one to one right there a real short gulp as long as you have that context and it's not a random one minutes fair value Gap or one minute or the block right there you need to have account text of the time frames above it otherwise you will get burned but let me show you something even more beautiful if we go into the five minute on the exact same piece of price actually so again this is the one hour five Valley Gap and we just use a five minute St then right there would have been the exact same entry but even better and then right there you have your one to two already you can't convince me that that is not sculpting because this reached your take profit you get tacked in and in the next candle it reaches your take profit that is the same as sculpting and I would argue even better it has higher probability not taking random fair value gaps Etc again you can see that when I talk about my plan everything that I do is fully fractal I mean that because this in the previous episode was also just a one hour entry and based on the last R trading plan it was also just a one hour entry this could have been a swing trading plan entry could have been a scalp could have been a day trade so whatever you want it to be then after a one hour PD rate has been reached then then we can go potentially into the 15 minute because then the 15 minute is also leaving behind something most likely and right there on that 15 minutes fair value Gap overlapping with that order block what do we have we have a new PD Ray to work with AKA we have a new boundary a new reason to go into the lower time frame to sculpt so when we go into the one minute based off of that 15 minute verify Gap you'll see that right here you don't need a lot of confirmation to work with because 15 minute and one minute they are closer to each other when you're using a one hour PD Ray you would need more confirmation based of your one minute time frame you have a bigger PD array so you have more candles to work with the lower the time frame 15 minute PD Ray one minute St is enough so right here that could be your entry it's medium term High Target or one to two right there and again how long did it take you from that candle to that candle 17 minutes is that not sculpting again are you in the edit right here and that trade took you 17 minutes to hit check profit but it took you a couple of days to wait for that trade to happen and to play out waiting for that high probability conditions that is where scalpers will mess up and every Trader in general will mess up because an unfruitful price action for example this waiting for that high probability scope right there that is where they will already blow the profits already being drawdown already below the account and that is exactly what I'm trying to tell you that sculpting does not mean that at any time of the day you go into the one minute time frame to take a trade the 17-minute trade happened at that 15 minute traffic up right there and you wait for the high probability price action which means you probably waited a couple of days before you got to that high probability price action and then you can sculpt sculpting is not getting involved every day every session every minute and again like a great investor once said the stock market is a device for transferring money from the inpatient to the patient that is the exact same thing with trading perfect let's continue so again that could be a second entry in the same exact London session right there then if we look at the following day what do we see because on the next day we have NFP and again NFP when you're scalping is beautiful and let me tell you why usually it just follows along with what the higher time frame was already intending to do what do I mean by that our daily bias was already bearish coming into that NFP day so when we see a huge Spike higher that is perfect because remember what we're doing at sculpting we're having that pea Ray or any PD array which we sting into at the right time so there's a Kill Zone or that is news when you have that and you see an entry pattern right there at that moment that is where you want to get involved so for example news stings into that one hour order block with that fair value Gap right there our daily bias was still bearish we had no reason to go higher from this level right there so right there if we go into the one minute again then we can see we now have a boundary to go into the lower time frame because we tapped into that one hour PD array with at the right time and again you need to understand you're not trading NFP itself here you're not executing on NFP you wouldn't do that you wait for NFP to show where it's going it stings into a certain PD array and then you just wait for your entry pattern after the NFP release that's the same for CPI fomc so we have an st right there then we have a new Fairfax app right there and we only sting into the first for Value Gap again right there you could take an overlapping part as well depending on your trading plan do you want to choose just a fair value Gap or always an overlapping part make a choice pick your poison then you cover again the intermediate term high right there and you again Target a one to two now again you can see the same exact thing what we just saw on this entry to the left right there this entry is not that great to be honest so again what you could do and what I would advise is you just take a five minute St instead of using the one minute right there and you just take a five minute St off of that move right there and then again same premise if we leave behind a 15 minute PD Ray ideally a 15 minute fare value Gap that you want to use that 15 minute fair value Gap to act as a new boundary to then go into the one minute time frame again and this right here is how you sculpt in the right way and the things you need to avoid doing those are probably even more important so again you still need context even if you scalp don't be lazy if you're lazy you will get left behind your competition will out work you don't worry in this video you can see how I basically debunked all the hype that we have nowadays all the concepts that are taught in this trading plan is everything you need more fancy does not equate to making more money so you won't see me coming out with the new best concept and this will give you 100 win rate yes don't get me wrong I can be clickbaity but I truly want the best for you and I can see through a lot of in this industry and then as well of course our slogan are you here to figure out an algorithm or are you here to make money more knowledge on a certain algo does not equate at all to making more money please have that at the top of your desk in front of your monitor wherever you want it I have that somewhere because whenever you get distracted by someone telling you the algorithm is now doing this this is that you don't need to know that always focus on making money stop trying to chase 100 win rate by figuring out some kind of Argo because you can either get left behind whilst others are just making money very comfortably or you can spend your entire lifetime trying to figure out an algorithm which will truly not benefit you that much if you do want more insights again go take a look at reo.io there I have my mentorship and I have a newsletter it's a completely free newsletter where I share very personal insights into trading as well and of course if you haven't seen the daily bias video which was the previous video of the a2c guide episode you can click on it here right now and I highly advise to watch that remember that I'm rooting for you I want the best for you and I think you came into trading for either one of the two reasons Freedom or money and that's exactly what I'm trying to teach here again I believe in you alright perfect thank you thank you foreign</p>

daily bias because you do and if you truly are convinced that you don't need a daily bias then I would ask yourself are you truly benefiting off of the fact that you're not using a daily bias or are you just being lazy and you don't want to put in the work because most of the time it's the latter where people are just lazy and they don't want to put in the work because it's too difficult you yes of course it's difficult you thought it was going to be easy you start being rich and having freedom in this world was going to be easy of course not that's what makes it fun the reward is so fun because it takes effort death feeling is so fulfilling so that is very important to understand then how can we sculpt first off we need to understand some kind of daily bias now the daily bias I'm going to be using as you may have already seen is the exact same one in the previous video so in the previous video we went over daily bias if you've not seen that just yet finish this video and afterwards watch that daily bias video it's the previous A to Z guide episode where we mentioned alright this fair value Gap is not strong right it's not a strong Verger right there then this fair value Gap is likely a strong perfect Gap because if this is not pushing price higher the FFL Gap then what will push price lower this premium rate in form of Death Valley Gap in between those fair value gaps all you're doing is your finding the high probability price action so you're looking at the stronger fair value gaps which fair value is stronger here this fair value Gap is weaker than that for Vega so this is the stronger fair value right what you're doing between this fair value Gap and that next Target right there you're letting the one hour guide you the one hour is your guide to your next Target so constantly you're letting the one hour guide in that one hour price action is what I will show you you're taking either one minute entries or five minute entries now to show you why you still need context and why you still need to be able to read price action on the higher time frame if we dive into this piece of price action right there on the one hour so here we are here we have the weak daily forever Gap and we have the strong daily for five Gap sitting right there as well then this price action what you would be doing you would be looking at structure based on the one hour so now you would be using time to your advantage and ideally as well news but there is an extract Confluence the video we talked about how you can use the news drivers to know which they will expand Etc that is an extra Confluence so time into a PD array and there you look for your confirmation now if we have a weak fair value Gap and we don't have clear context right there because this is a weak fair value Gap they're not really bullish we're not really bearish then what is happening we take this order block when we dive into the one minute what will you see you'll see here that when coming into that discount rate that order block on the one hour that we will take a lot of losses right there why because the context is not supporting the ID that is why when you're just taking random one minute verify gaps everywhere that will not be sustainable on the long term why not let me tell you if we zoom out back onto the one hour time frame what will we see we will see that high probability price action for example when coming off of this strong daily feather Gap right there this pushes price lower in a very short amount of time in what is it one day and 16 hours this verify Gap right there did what it took about five days and 18 hours to push price higher low probability conditions will last way longer than high probability conditions so for sculpting it is very important to also identify the high probability conditions especially when you're on the lower time frame like the one minute because on the one minute you can extremely easily blow an account because there's always a reason to justify a trade ID on the one minute the entries will all look the same what is difference between one one minute for Value Gap and the other one minute fair value Gap it's what happened before that it's the boundary that needs to get hit first and then we have the one-man February Gap that is where you want to enter so let me show you what I mean with that if we have no boundary like I just mentioned and we go into the one minute time frame then we can take every one minute fare value Gap as an entry does that mean it's a good entry absolutely not what is the boundary that happens before that that is what differentiates a week one minute traffic from a strong one minute there needs to be a boundary before that the boundary is a one hour PD array or a 15 minute PD array again when coming off of ideally a daily fair value Gap or a daily PD array so first off you need to have the daily somewhat agreeing to your idea to go into the one hour because what we just saw is that if we have the one hour agreeing right here but we don't have the daily agreeing so right here we have the one hour agreeing going higher but we don't really have the daily agreeing not really a strong for Vega then we will take a lot of hit before we get the right move and that is very dangerous in sculpting because in sculpting like in the industry they show you all the wins but if we took every one minute verify Gap that was sitting right here we would have taken 10 hits before we get a win and that one win yes we can brag about it on Instagram on Twitter whatever and that's usually what people to do but they don't tell you or they forget to tell you quote unquote forget about the 10 losses that they took because they were identical when you have one minutes verify gaps that are identical which one are you taking you need somewhat of a guideline right there and the guideline is whatever happens before that so A one hour PD Ray in context of your daily bias again remember the daily bias respecting and disrespecting Etc we established on a daily time frame here a week for flag up strong fair value Gap respect because we are wicking next Target could be that daily discount array in the form of that swing low right there so that is our context in between that high and that low right there that is where we want to get involved ideally because we have high probability price action right there then if we go into the one hour we need the one hour to show fair value gaps lower to agree with the ID of going lower indeed right here this is the next day we have a new fair value Gap so first we respected that for Vi Gap based on the daily time frame now we have a new day right there showing a new bearish fair value Gap inside that provide Gap that is your one hour PD Ray that you will use to go into the one minute to now scalp now the reason I say you can also use the five minutes usually what people think is going into the one minute means that you are sculpting or going into the second time frame Etc what if I tell you you can make it easier for yourself and the five minute you can achieve the exact same entry as you would have taken on the one minute maybe even a better entry but the five minute usually isn't fancy enough for people the five minute you can achieve the exact same entries and it would still be scoping let me show you what I mean with that if we dive into the one minute on that one hour fare value Gap right there then once we are here what do you want to do you want to wait for your St and then you want to wait for your new February leg up lower which once we have an SD right here then we have a new verify Gap lower right there as well that is where you can place your entry on the overlapping part with those lows there as well and you cover what do you cover the intermediate term high that is right there what do you target well since you are sculpting you have a close Target you get in you get out so ideally at first a one to two a one to two is perfectly fine to Target at first so somewhere around they're perfectly fine and again you don't need to do this right because you could have also very well done a real scalp where you now enter off of this overlapping part because that is also already valid you cover the fair value Gap and you charge a one two two a one to one right there a real short gulp as long as you have that context and it's not a random one minutes fair value Gap or one minute or the block right there you need to have account text of the time frames above it otherwise you will get burned but let me show you something even more beautiful if we go into the five minute on the exact same piece of price actually so again this is the one hour five Valley Gap and we just use a five minute St then right there would have been the exact same entry but even better and then right there you have your one to two already you can't convince me that that is not sculpting because this reached your take profit you get tacked in and in the next candle it reaches your take profit that is the same as sculpting and I would argue even better it has higher probability not taking random fair value gaps Etc again you can see that when I talk about my plan everything that I do is fully fractal I mean that because this in the previous episode was also just a one hour entry and based on the last R trading plan it was also just a one hour entry this could have been a swing trading plan entry could have been a scalp could have been a day trade so whatever you want it to be then after a one hour PD rate has been reached then then we can go potentially into the 15 minute because then the 15 minute is also leaving behind something most likely and right there on that 15 minutes fair value Gap overlapping with that order block what do we have we have a new PD Ray to work with AKA we have a new boundary a new reason to go into the lower time frame to sculpt so when we go into the one minute based off of that 15 minute verify Gap you'll see that right here you don't need a lot of confirmation to work with because 15 minute and one minute they are closer to each other when you're using a one hour PD Ray you would need more confirmation based of your one minute time frame you have a bigger PD array so you have more candles to work with the lower the time frame 15 minute PD Ray one minute St is enough so right here that could be your entry it's medium term High Target or one to two right there and again how long did it take you from that candle to that candle 17 minutes is that not sculpting again are you in the edit right here and that trade took you 17 minutes to hit check profit but it took you a couple of days to wait for that trade to happen and to play out waiting for that high probability conditions that is where scalpers will mess up and every Trader in general will mess up because an unfruitful price action for example this waiting for that high probability scope right there that is where they will already blow the profits already being drawdown already below the account and that is exactly what I'm trying to tell you that sculpting does not mean that at any time of the day you go into the one minute time frame to take a trade the 17-minute trade happened at that 15 minute traffic up right there and you wait for the high probability price action which means you probably waited a couple of days before you got to that high probability price action and then you can sculpt sculpting is not getting involved every day every session every minute and again like a great investor once said the stock market is a device for transferring money from the inpatient to the patient that is the exact same thing with trading perfect let's continue so again that could be a second entry in the same exact London session right there then if we look at the following day what do we see because on the next day we have NFP and again NFP when you're scalping is beautiful and let me tell you why usually it just follows along with what the higher time frame was already intending to do what do I mean by that our daily bias was already bearish coming into that NFP day so when we see a huge Spike higher that is perfect because remember what we're doing at sculpting we're having that pea Ray or any PD array which we sting into at the right time so there's a Kill Zone or that is news when you have that and you see an entry pattern right there at that moment that is where you want to get involved so for example news stings into that one hour order block with that fair value Gap right there our daily bias was still bearish we had no reason to go higher from this level right there so right there if we go into the one minute again then we can see we now have a boundary to go into the lower time frame because we tapped into that one hour PD array with at the right time and again you need to understand you're not trading NFP itself here you're not executing on NFP you wouldn't do that you wait for NFP to show where it's going it stings into a certain PD array and then you just wait for your entry pattern after the NFP release that's the same for CPI fomc so we have an st right there then we have a new Fairfax app right there and we only sting into the first for Value Gap again right there you could take an overlapping part as well depending on your trading plan do you want to choose just a fair value Gap or always an overlapping part make a choice pick your poison then you cover again the intermediate term high right there and you again Target a one to two now again you can see the same exact thing what we just saw on this entry to the left right there this entry is not that great to be honest so again what you could do and what I would advise is you just take a five minute St instead of using the one minute right there and you just take a five minute St off of that move right there and then again same premise if we leave behind a 15 minute PD Ray ideally a 15 minute fare value Gap that you want to use that 15 minute fair value Gap to act as a new boundary to then go into the one minute time frame again and this right here is how you sculpt in the right way and the things you need to avoid doing those are probably even more important so again you still need context even if you scalp don't be lazy if you're lazy you will get left behind your competition will out work you don't worry in this video you can see how I basically debunked all the hype that we have nowadays all the concepts that are taught in this trading plan is everything you need more fancy does not equate to making more money so you won't see me coming out with the new best concept and this will give you 100 win rate yes don't get me wrong I can be clickbaity but I truly want the best for you and I can see through a lot of in this industry and then as well of course our slogan are you here to figure out an algorithm or are you here to make money more knowledge on a certain algo does not equate at all to making more money please have that at the top of your desk in front of your monitor wherever you want it I have that somewhere because whenever you get distracted by someone telling you the algorithm is now doing this this is that you don't need to know that always focus on making money stop trying to chase 100 win rate by figuring out some kind of Argo because you can either get left behind whilst others are just making money very comfortably or you can spend your entire lifetime trying to figure out an algorithm which will truly not benefit you that much if you do want more insights again go take a look at reo.io there I have my mentorship and I have a newsletter it's a completely free newsletter where I share very personal insights into trading as well and of course if you haven't seen the daily bias video which was the previous video of the a2c guide episode you can click on it here right now and I highly advise to watch that remember that I'm rooting for you I want the best for you and I think you came into trading for either one of the two reasons Freedom or money and that's exactly what I'm trying to teach here again I believe in you alright perfect thank you thank you foreign

## <p>trading weekly profiles that is exactly what we are going to be touching on here how can we know what weekly profile will play out and what are the characteristics of each individual day as you might hear my voice is a little bit gone so bear with me I will talk as clear as I possibly can for you to understand so there is a certain characteristics for each day and for each week but usually these weekly profiles that are being taught there are so much random weekly profiles that you can make an argument for everything so how can we narrow that down and how can we actually know which weekly profile will happen and will play out or at least have the highest probability of knowing in this case in the top right you see Range High of the week trends Trend again but TR and TGIF Thank God It's Friday don't worry I'm going over each and every one right here so if we take a look at the daily time frame right here on EU again this is applicable to every Market here what do we see this is our Monday Monday is a range here let me actually remove the lines perfect so Monday here is a range it is indecisive it is also a consolidation somewhat now what does this leave behind this creates what a daily fair value cap then on Tuesday we sting into that daily fair value Gap creating what the high of the week then Wednesday is what it is a trend day and Thursday is also a trending day but at the end of Thursday you have to be careful that you're not shorting anymore because when we are getting closer to the end of the week so that is the end of Thursday and Friday we will likely cap the week what is Cap the week mean on a bearish week we will make the low of the week on Thursday or Friday most likely and how can we know if Thursday or Friday makes a low if Thursday already displaces higher shows displacement and signs that it wants to go higher and Thursday as a likely kept at the range and Friday will fail to take out Thursday's low if Thursday doesn't have a displacement and closes pretty low for example here the candle closes pretty low relatively to the wick in this case you will most of the time see a Thank God It's Friday setup where we sweep the previous day low of Thursday and then shoot back up in the range and then we close inside the range how can we know how can we know that the wig will play out like this ahead of time so on a Sunday I want to know how the week plays out well let me tell you you won't you won't know for sure how the week will play out and how the week will form ahead of time but if we take a look and this is where your own studying comes in and this is a big hint from me if you take a look at this week's price action so that is the 15th of May until the 19th of May if you search for the economic calendar on this week's price action you will see where the news events come in on which date they come into the market and on those days that is where the volatility will be on the day of news events that is where volatility will be so for example on Tuesday here we had a news event that news event on Tuesday had the most volatility for that week in order for price to move what does it need it needs volatility so when Monday doesn't have a clear premium array hovering above it and it is somewhat ranging that Tuesday does have a premium array hovering above it right there and it has the volatility price action and the volatility are in harmony that is how you can know how the week will play out and that is exactly how I knew on this Sunday or this week how I knew ahead of time how the week would play out I called on a Sunday where the low of the week will be on which day it can likely happen and where we can expand swords if you don't believe me you can take a look at the live stream on the 14th of May on Sunday and of course since EU is just inversed we were expecting the same for EU so what do I mean with if Monday was hovering below a premium array or there was a premium rate hovering above Monday what do I mean by that well let's say that this was a Friday that Monday might have done this because Monday already had a higher time frame premium rate that it can sting into so if Monday already had a sting into that high time from premium Ray then Tuesday will likely just expand and won't take out Monday's high same for what you see here Tuesday stings into that high time from premium rate so Wednesday is expending it is not taking out Tuesday's High it doesn't need to so what is important here it is crucial for you to understand the higher time frame PD race and the economic calendar reading the candles day by day that is important so if we mark this premium array and dive into the one hour right here what do we see we are coming into that daily verify Gap we are displacing lower right here what is this this is already your one shot one kill one shot one kill refers to catching the weekly range where you generally take one trade a week and you're trying to catch the majority of the weekly range this is exactly how you can do that now what would you target here remember what we talked about we talked about premium array to what a discount array now for the weekly range we will expand even lower than of course just this swing low especially if you're trading on the one hour the one hour if you're targeting this then obviously a 0.77 RR that's not worth it so we target something lower in the form of what what do we see here we have a liquidity pool right there and if I show you the dollar in a few moments it will even be more clear on what your target should be so this can be a Target right there that's enough that is your one shot one kill 2.74 r that is if you can do that consistently on a weekly basis you are out performing a lot of hedge funds and there are a lot of investors that are willing to work with you believe me so we drop down back into the one hour again as you can see right here what do we see we all have continuation trades right there notice how I'm using very value gaps a very value gaps are at the core of my strategy I love fair value caps without fair value gaps I can't operate it is of course a personal thing you might do very well in price action without fair value gaps I do very well in markets with fair value gaps what is this overlapping with as well what did we talk about way at the beginning of the A2Z guide remember the PD Rays mitigation block right there and nested in that an order block as well so there's three there's three levels of Defense right there and if you zoom out just a bit on the four hour right now bare value Gap overlapping again with that mitigation block isn't that beautiful so on Wednesday we continue that Trend but again it is very important for you to understand that there are set parameters that will play out over and over so this format this Tuesday high of the week and Friday in this case low of the week will play out a lot of the times the thing is you are not going to go into Sunday and think Yep this is a Tuesday Hive the week no in the live stream that I did ahead of this week you'll hear me say as well but during the week we would have to adjust and have to react to What happens in that time what I thought of price so on Monday consolidation that exactly played out if Monday wasn't a consolidation here it would have been a whole different story so you react and you adapt constantly same here Wednesday is a trending day and then it suddenly retraces into what something on the higher time frame again into that mitigation block and then it continues on Thursday and then at the end of Thursday you have to be careful that you are not right here off of this for Vega for example that you're not trying to short we have already been expanding lower a lot of Pips this week so at the end of Thursday and going into Friday this is not a high probability shorting opportunity anymore either you got in here on the one hour either you got in here on the four hour and maybe a lower time frame confirmation but don't try to get in here now you are trying to chase price but instead what can we do instead well Thursday doesn't have a displacement higher so what happens right there can you see it previous day low sweep turtle soup boom we continue higher on the 15 minute what happens here well we have this turtle soup liquidity sweep and then what do we have right there isn't that a beautiful entry now what would you target here because obviously this is a bit of a different scenario you are now trying to catch the low of the week it's a bit of a different scenario so what would you target here once we cap the week so either on a Thursday or a Friday we will Target to rebalance something inside the weekly range so if we take a look at the four hour we are rebalancing this fair value Gap with this old block why not this fair value Gap to overlapping premium arrays so at that time once we reached that that is the same premise is that we don't short right here we don't look for new lungs in this premium array so right here take your profit and be done be grateful be happy for that week that's it that's the week done so essentially right here from this sweep boom dead to that area to this area that is where you want to play that is where you want to get involved after we reach that you don't want to get involved anymore so from this area to this area what is unfolding on the lower time frame a market maker buy model from this area to this area what is unfolding a market maker shell model again marker make buy models marker make cell models and kill zones and due to swings everything we will go over in the ATZ guide it is called A to Z guide for a reason now as well how can we know where the weak will likely close I would like to invite you to draw your Fibonacci on the low of the week to the high of the week of course at that time we don't know for certain if this is the low of the week we can make a guess this die of the week of course because we've been expanding lower and we can now make a good guess that this is the low of the week so when we have that the 0.3 and the 0.2 that is a great indication of where we will close during that week so once we reach this that right there is likely where we will close in close proximity to this area on your Fibonacci too now I already want you to think in The Next Step because this weekly profile is fractal why is this fractal what is so fractal about it remember to kill zones or if you don't know about kill zones don't worry it's something we will get into if you already know about the kill zones let me give you a beautiful hint of what we're going to go into in the next coming videos when we are going to be touching on daily profiles so daily profiles Asian range London if London makes a high of the day what is New York likely going to do retracement continues what London already made what do we see here London close isn't this absolutely mind-blowing it is the beauty of price action this makes price action so beautiful when you understand these Concepts in the A2Z guide everything becomes so clear everything can be done in a mechanical way in a step-by-step manner to focus truly on what our goal is and that is making money in these markets making money from Trading again not Financial advice of course all right now let's give you one more bullish example just to top it off alright perfect so here we are on the dollar now this was the exact same week just to show you what we were looking at and what Target was for that week so right here we came into that daily fair value Gap as well with on a four hour we had this overlapping a high this overlapping mitigation block then we were expending higher and the target was very clear on the dollar because we had this fair value Gap and that is exactly where we kept the week now as you can see on a Thursday we didn't have a huge displacement and Friday didn't take out Thursday's high but look closely what do we have what is this on the lower time frame with EU it is smt uh-huh all right now I want you to show you a couple of different weeks of course because this is only one of the weekly profiles now there is no benefit of me giving you weekly templates because that is not how it works I can give you weekly templates and there will be a dude or a woman who will sit on a Sunday and look at the chart and think Hmm this weekly template it is called the special Enigma template this weekly profile I think this might be the one this week who knows and in that way you are also messing up your mind because when you establish that and you say to yourself This weekly template will play out then you will be so focused on that Weekly template that you will not be reacting anymore that is absolutely detrimental and of course with experience you can acknowledge that so if I tell you on a Sunday this weekly template might play out I know for myself that I will still be reacting and that I might be fully wrong so right here if we take this lag down what do we see we have another weekly profile right here now let me just show you the week in this case it is a bit of a different weekly profile because right here Wednesday makes the low of the week and a high of the week how can we react to this well Monday wasn't necessarily coming into premium Ray it is just an expansion of what we already had last week then Thursday is not even close to any premium array so looking for shorts or logs on that day is futile it is nonsense you are trying to catch a trade in a low probability trading day and then right here this is interesting because now we have a liquidity sweep right there what can we target this fair value Gap and right here we can already start looking or short going into Thursday going into Friday see how the general parameters of the weekly range are the same but I'm reacting and the economic calendar was different during this week why because we had CPI on a Tuesday and after that after CPI the volatility comes into the market boom right there there it is coupled again with a news event making the high of the week and even the low of the week now if we continue what do we see here we already see we are coming out of this BPR this fair value Gap this breaker We are continuing lower we are still expanding lower when Monday expands like this can we now expect Tuesday to do something like this and then consumer no that is very illogical those are not characteristics of price action right here we had a pretty low close as well now if this Tuesday was a pretty high close what do I mean with a high close we had an up close day and we closed pretty high relatively to the wick and then the odds of seeing a previous day I sweep into a fair value Gap then they are increased that is the thing we saw on EU just now so right here we are just expanding so on the four hour only one hour you might still be able to catch this or like I always say you either get in here or you wait for retracement to get in on the expansion again because if you wait for retracement then you can write the expansion again right here you are chasing price now and again beautiful and this is where you could catch the low of the week why what do we see previous day low sweep Thursday has that displacement that we talked about so right here be very careful we've been expanding lower we are arriving at a Thursday the TR and it's called that for a reason because the trend might just end and we have a displacement a higher right there and then we continue even higher on that Friday so knowing the PD arrays knowing when we will stick into it how can we know when we will stick into it economic calendar volatility we need volatility to trade and reacting and adapting to different days there's not one single weekly template that happens every single week you have to be able to react and adapt where are we currently on which day are we there where are we currently are we hovering below or above a premium or discount array is volatility coming into the market can we sting into that PD array can we then continue that Trend where will the trend likely end for that week all questions you can ask yourself there's a step-by-step method this is all stuff we go very in depth on inside the master class and inside the mentorship in general also the basic because the mentorship knows what I'm talking about and the mentorship also knows how valuable these videos are because mentorship members always come up to me and they say are these videos on the A2Z guide they are absolutely incredible they match the content of the mentorship perfectly and that's what I'm here for right I am here to help you make money from Trading not Financial advice alright study this and I will see you on Friday at 8 30 on a new A to Z guide episode perfect thank you foreign foreign [Music]</p>

on a Sunday where the low of the week will be on which day it can likely happen and where we can expand swords if you don't believe me you can take a look at the live stream on the 14th of May on Sunday and of course since EU is just inversed we were expecting the same for EU so what do I mean with if Monday was hovering below a premium array or there was a premium rate hovering above Monday what do I mean by that well let's say that this was a Friday that Monday might have done this because Monday already had a higher time frame premium rate that it can sting into so if Monday already had a sting into that high time from premium Ray then Tuesday will likely just expand and won't take out Monday's high same for what you see here Tuesday stings into that high time from premium rate so Wednesday is expending it is not taking out Tuesday's High it doesn't need to so what is important here it is crucial for you to understand the higher time frame PD race and the economic calendar reading the candles day by day that is important so if we mark this premium array and dive into the one hour right here what do we see we are coming into that daily verify Gap we are displacing lower right here what is this this is already your one shot one kill one shot one kill refers to catching the weekly range where you generally take one trade a week and you're trying to catch the majority of the weekly range this is exactly how you can do that now what would you target here remember what we talked about we talked about premium array to what a discount array now for the weekly range we will expand even lower than of course just this swing low especially if you're trading on the one hour the one hour if you're targeting this then obviously a 0.77 RR that's not worth it so we target something lower in the form of what what do we see here we have a liquidity pool right there and if I show you the dollar in a few moments it will even be more clear on what your target should be so this can be a Target right there that's enough that is your one shot one kill 2.74 r that is if you can do that consistently on a weekly basis you are out performing a lot of hedge funds and there are a lot of investors that are willing to work with you believe me so we drop down back into the one hour again as you can see right here what do we see we all have continuation trades right there notice how I'm using very value gaps a very value gaps are at the core of my strategy I love fair value caps without fair value gaps I can't operate it is of course a personal thing you might do very well in price action without fair value gaps I do very well in markets with fair value gaps what is this overlapping with as well what did we talk about way at the beginning of the A2Z guide remember the PD Rays mitigation block right there and nested in that an order block as well so there's three there's three levels of Defense right there and if you zoom out just a bit on the four hour right now bare value Gap overlapping again with that mitigation block isn't that beautiful so on Wednesday we continue that Trend but again it is very important for you to understand that there are set parameters that will play out over and over so this format this Tuesday high of the week and Friday in this case low of the week will play out a lot of the times the thing is you are not going to go into Sunday and think Yep this is a Tuesday Hive the week no in the live stream that I did ahead of this week you'll hear me say as well but during the week we would have to adjust and have to react to What happens in that time what I thought of price so on Monday consolidation that exactly played out if Monday wasn't a consolidation here it would have been a whole different story so you react and you adapt constantly same here Wednesday is a trending day and then it suddenly retraces into what something on the higher time frame again into that mitigation block and then it continues on Thursday and then at the end of Thursday you have to be careful that you are not right here off of this for Vega for example that you're not trying to short we have already been expanding lower a lot of Pips this week so at the end of Thursday and going into Friday this is not a high probability shorting opportunity anymore either you got in here on the one hour either you got in here on the four hour and maybe a lower time frame confirmation but don't try to get in here now you are trying to chase price but instead what can we do instead well Thursday doesn't have a displacement higher so what happens right there can you see it previous day low sweep turtle soup boom we continue higher on the 15 minute what happens here well we have this turtle soup liquidity sweep and then what do we have right there isn't that a beautiful entry now what would you target here because obviously this is a bit of a different scenario you are now trying to catch the low of the week it's a bit of a different scenario so what would you target here once we cap the week so either on a Thursday or a Friday we will Target to rebalance something inside the weekly range so if we take a look at the four hour we are rebalancing this fair value Gap with this old block why not this fair value Gap to overlapping premium arrays so at that time once we reached that that is the same premise is that we don't short right here we don't look for new lungs in this premium array so right here take your profit and be done be grateful be happy for that week that's it that's the week done so essentially right here from this sweep boom dead to that area to this area that is where you want to play that is where you want to get involved after we reach that you don't want to get involved anymore so from this area to this area what is unfolding on the lower time frame a market maker buy model from this area to this area what is unfolding a market maker shell model again marker make buy models marker make cell models and kill zones and due to swings everything we will go over in the ATZ guide it is called A to Z guide for a reason now as well how can we know where the weak will likely close I would like to invite you to draw your Fibonacci on the low of the week to the high of the week of course at that time we don't know for certain if this is the low of the week we can make a guess this die of the week of course because we've been expanding lower and we can now make a good guess that this is the low of the week so when we have that the 0.3 and the 0.2 that is a great indication of where we will close during that week so once we reach this that right there is likely where we will close in close proximity to this area on your Fibonacci too now I already want you to think in The Next Step because this weekly profile is fractal why is this fractal what is so fractal about it remember to kill zones or if you don't know about kill zones don't worry it's something we will get into if you already know about the kill zones let me give you a beautiful hint of what we're going to go into in the next coming videos when we are going to be touching on daily profiles so daily profiles Asian range London if London makes a high of the day what is New York likely going to do retracement continues what London already made what do we see here London close isn't this absolutely mind-blowing it is the beauty of price action this makes price action so beautiful when you understand these Concepts in the A2Z guide everything becomes so clear everything can be done in a mechanical way in a step-by-step manner to focus truly on what our goal is and that is making money in these markets making money from Trading again not Financial advice of course all right now let's give you one more bullish example just to top it off alright perfect so here we are on the dollar now this was the exact same week just to show you what we were looking at and what Target was for that week so right here we came into that daily fair value Gap as well with on a four hour we had this overlapping a high this overlapping mitigation block then we were expending higher and the target was very clear on the dollar because we had this fair value Gap and that is exactly where we kept the week now as you can see on a Thursday we didn't have a huge displacement and Friday didn't take out Thursday's high but look closely what do we have what is this on the lower time frame with EU it is smt uh-huh all right now I want you to show you a couple of different weeks of course because this is only one of the weekly profiles now there is no benefit of me giving you weekly templates because that is not how it works I can give you weekly templates and there will be a dude or a woman who will sit on a Sunday and look at the chart and think Hmm this weekly template it is called the special Enigma template this weekly profile I think this might be the one this week who knows and in that way you are also messing up your mind because when you establish that and you say to yourself This weekly template will play out then you will be so focused on that Weekly template that you will not be reacting anymore that is absolutely detrimental and of course with experience you can acknowledge that so if I tell you on a Sunday this weekly template might play out I know for myself that I will still be reacting and that I might be fully wrong so right here if we take this lag down what do we see we have another weekly profile right here now let me just show you the week in this case it is a bit of a different weekly profile because right here Wednesday makes the low of the week and a high of the week how can we react to this well Monday wasn't necessarily coming into premium Ray it is just an expansion of what we already had last week then Thursday is not even close to any premium array so looking for shorts or logs on that day is futile it is nonsense you are trying to catch a trade in a low probability trading day and then right here this is interesting because now we have a liquidity sweep right there what can we target this fair value Gap and right here we can already start looking or short going into Thursday going into Friday see how the general parameters of the weekly range are the same but I'm reacting and the economic calendar was different during this week why because we had CPI on a Tuesday and after that after CPI the volatility comes into the market boom right there there it is coupled again with a news event making the high of the week and even the low of the week now if we continue what do we see here we already see we are coming out of this BPR this fair value Gap this breaker We are continuing lower we are still expanding lower when Monday expands like this can we now expect Tuesday to do something like this and then consumer no that is very illogical those are not characteristics of price action right here we had a pretty low close as well now if this Tuesday was a pretty high close what do I mean with a high close we had an up close day and we closed pretty high relatively to the wick and then the odds of seeing a previous day I sweep into a fair value Gap then they are increased that is the thing we saw on EU just now so right here we are just expanding so on the four hour only one hour you might still be able to catch this or like I always say you either get in here or you wait for retracement to get in on the expansion again because if you wait for retracement then you can write the expansion again right here you are chasing price now and again beautiful and this is where you could catch the low of the week why what do we see previous day low sweep Thursday has that displacement that we talked about so right here be very careful we've been expanding lower we are arriving at a Thursday the TR and it's called that for a reason because the trend might just end and we have a displacement a higher right there and then we continue even higher on that Friday so knowing the PD arrays knowing when we will stick into it how can we know when we will stick into it economic calendar volatility we need volatility to trade and reacting and adapting to different days there's not one single weekly template that happens every single week you have to be able to react and adapt where are we currently on which day are we there where are we currently are we hovering below or above a premium or discount array is volatility coming into the market can we sting into that PD array can we then continue that Trend where will the trend likely end for that week all questions you can ask yourself there's a step-by-step method this is all stuff we go very in depth on inside the master class and inside the mentorship in general also the basic because the mentorship knows what I'm talking about and the mentorship also knows how valuable these videos are because mentorship members always come up to me and they say are these videos on the A2Z guide they are absolutely incredible they match the content of the mentorship perfectly and that's what I'm here for right I am here to help you make money from Trading not Financial advice alright study this and I will see you on Friday at 8 30 on a new A to Z guide episode perfect thank you foreign foreign [Music]

## <p>just before we start the video this episode is not for the weak people this episode will exactly be according to my plan that is filtering out the weak Traders from the strong Traders for all you strong traders that will listen to the entire thing you can treat this as a podcast there is not much going on on the screen itself nothing that will be important to you take the lessons from it and out compete your competition I hope you're ready or a life-changing lesson so today we have a very valuable video now this will not be the most fancy video a lot of people will ignore this video and the ones that do watch it will absolutely be destined for Success because this will be the most valuable lesson in the whole A to Z guide you absolutely need to hear this every single bit of it throughout this video I will touch on all the things I wanted to know before I got into trading so whenever I refer to you should do this you should do that I'm also referring to you as in you the person watching this but I'm also talking to my younger self if I knew all this and I was in the place where you were in you found the ATC guide you potentially even found the mmt the money making team then you are extremely lucky to have found that but it means nothing without the right mindset if you can combine the teachings that I have here on YouTube in the mmt and you have the right mindset then there's no reason for you not to be successful in a very short amount of time and that's why I will share this because if you can learn from this have the right mindset then believe me all it does take is time and there's nothing stopping you the only thing holding you back is time that is very important to realize and by knowing this you will accelerate your learning curve why because you are learning from my mistakes and from my experience so we will speed up your own progress now the first thing I want to mention is don't backtest never look to backtest with back testing with back testing I'm referring to using old data old charts and using the replay tool or another two and replaying the data and trying to trade it where you can just have a few clicks and you skip price for example here on gu right here you would do this and then eventually you just skip price fast fast fast fast to get to an entry this is not what you want to be doing this is going to be extremely detrimental I think we all know a backdesting warrior and what is a backdesting warrior someone that only shows up with some back testing stats every once in a while doesn't actually live trade or try to attempt to live trade all they do is constantly back their stem back they stem back test you're not going to to achieve anything by just back testing literally nothing if anything you are doing the opposite it's extremely detrimental and let me explain why back testing is making you comfortable you will never learn the emotional lessons that you need to learn in live trading in forward testing again not Financial advice but you will never learn the same emotional lessons back testing is like Tick Tock if you don't like something you swipe 20 times until you find a new video that you like within two seconds if I were to take a loss here on gu and I entered right there for example then it only takes me what is it 20 clicks to Now find a winner oh I take a loss oh let me just click a few more clicks nice now I have a winner can you see how extremely detriment that is for your psychology because in real time when you're forward testing what does that do when you take that loss you can't skip over 20 candles to take a winner so that thing that you used to do in back testing you can't do it so what is the next step if you are for testing you are going to force something or you're going to flick through other pairs other instruments and find a trait that you can potentially take and you start Revenge trading over trading because you have this habit of skipping price and trying to find the next winner to make yourself comfortable if you are in this back testing phase and in this back testing cycle because it's a cycle every time you lose a forward testing that is going to be very uncomfortable but if you're a back testing Warrior you will go back and you will back test to make yourself comfortable and to get a few dopamine hits do you see a few winners because you can just skip through price that is an extremely unhealthy habit it be uncomfortable after a loss that's normal that's a process an emotional process you need to go through if you never experience it then you will never learn you will never get better pain is there to get better from again maybe pain is a little bit of an exaggeration but it is an uncomfortable feeling losing I still lose it's not a nice feeling I don't like it I'm not going to sit here and lie about it that yes oh I love I love losing no absolutely not I hate losing I don't like it feels uncomfortable but I can acknowledge the uncomfortable feeling and I'm like alright I now feel uncomfortable I know I feel uncomfortable but there's nothing I can do about it right now it's just part of the process I'm not seeking that comfortable Feeling by going back into back testing mode extremely dangerous I would also advise there's no need to backtest at all zero reason to backtest or test an hindsight back test so only in hindsight look through your back test and then four tests be ready that you are going to lose it's going to be uncomfortable and that is very important to understand the things I've also written down here with back testing you will never experience a losing streak you will never experience the mental challenges that will come with live trading everyone can understand the technicals name someone truly this is a challenge for you truly try to name someone name someone that idiotic that can't understand the technicals there's no one in this world I refuse to believe there's anyone in this world unless you have a true mental disability but I truly believe there's no one in this world that can't understand the technicals so when that is the case it's not about technicals is it that's not why 99 feel 99 doesn't feel because they don't understand the technicals no it's not rocket science and even if it was rocket science enough people would be able to be profitable if they can understand the technicals but that's not the case 99 can't overcome their human instincts their human nature their psychology they can't control themselves they don't have self-control they fall for every trap that the market is setting out for you and I'm not talking about a liquidity trap I'm talking about the market is playing games with your mind and you are playing games with your mind and everyone around you is playing games with your mind because social media mentors throwing A New Concept at you every single week that's also something we'll touch on again always look to four tests to win eventually you need to learn through pain you need to experience pain back testing is not going to give you that pain stop back testing it's not good there are extremely unhealthy habits attached to back testing and the pros do not outweigh the cons to be honest I don't see a lot of Pros with back testing at all then the next one is follow One Mentor whoever that Mentor may be I don't care who who that Mentor is is it me is it someone else I don't really care as long as you follow that Mentor religiously now again don't idolize that is also something we will touch on in this video when you follow One Mentor you will get used to his thinking now again of course not every Mentor wants the best for you that is also and that can be extremely difficult in this trading industry so if you want to be certain if someone wants the best for you then you can notice certain characteristics in the way they teach in how they teach for example do they throw New Concepts at you every week do they tell you exactly how to apply the concepts do they show you in real time how the concepts are applied do they give you psychology lessons or is it only about the technicals all these and of course more are things to ask yourselves now does your Mentor really want the best for you and if you're in doubt you can always choose me as your Mentor because I think I fit all the criteria right there as well as the live trading which we do in the money making team because this is one of the trades right here that we were able to catch in the money making team right there all done live then the next thing is when you have that one Mentor you don't want to be active on social media because you don't want your mind to get affected by other mentors or other people telling you different things because then you activate your shiny object syndrome eventually so everything that I'm telling you here is I'm protecting you from yourself because I have been there I'm talking to myself in this video we all go through the same stages where you have a mentor but you're not really satisfied so you start looking for a new mentor and a new shiny object and something new you want something better and eventually you're just in this endless cycle and you never truly get anywhere and then your years further along the line and you never truly got anywhere and you might be in a back testing cycle where you test a New Concept every week I'm sorry but I don't have the time to do that I don't have the time to waste years on that so that is exactly why I'm giving you the lessons right here social media is truly not that relevant at all unless you're a Creator and not a consumer then I would say go for it if you're genuinely trying to help people but if you're just a consumer it's not that great you're not missing out on anything on social media truly believe me if your Mentor is on social media then again follow your Mentor but don't listen to what anyone else besides your Mentor is telling you stick to one thing only one Mentor then as well when you are going to trade and you are in your trading mode so you are forward testing you are live training whatever you are doing you don't want to be active on social media as well and the reason for that is again if you take one losing trade or you have one bad week for example then all of a sudden you see someone on Twitter Instagram another Guru mention A New Concept Etc and you get thrown off shiny object syndrome you start to doubt yourself you're insecure and then eventually it leads to this new cycle that endless shiny objection syndrome cycle so a funny thing that I actually emote out to the newsletter was that have you ever noticed that after a bad price action week or after a bad trading week where we know the majority of the people had a somewhat bad trading week have you ever noticed that on Twitter Instagram wherever usually it's Twitter because there you can influence people more directly have you ever noticed that a new fancy concept shows up it's just something to think about remember the cycle we had the trend with Turtle soups remember the macros or they're even the Reapers when did these new Concepts happen when we had absolutely shitty price action and let me tell you the reason for that is because when you have high probability conditions for your trading plan there will also be low probability conditions and in these low property conditions you just want to stay out of the market and that's difficult because that requires patience that patients that pain that uncomfortable feeling can only be acquired through four testing to through live trading not through back testing and in those low probability conditions that are low probability conditions for you that will be someone else's high probability condition again that is picking your poison you don't have to trade both pick your poison less is more in trading if you're trying to trade both that will not work so someone else will share their high probability commissions and they will say well this concept did great this week and you will think I need that concept because I did bad this week you don't need the concept you don't please listen to me you don't you will because that week was high probability the condition for that concept but then you don't take into account the low profit conditions for that concept so once you are used to that concept and you're Now using A New Concept what happens when low property conditions show up again then you will have the same cycle and you will maybe refer back to your old concept that you were using because that it was high probability in the other Concepts low probability conditions so they are inverse invertly correlated you could say you need to be conscious of that with everything you need to be conscious very conscious of everything that you're doing a lot of people don't think they don't think you need to think about things everything question everything do people want the best for you even question me do I want the best for you does Arya want the best for me is he truly helping me is he a genuine human being it's all things you need to question every single little thing think about everything it won't do your harm it will only bring you good very important so then the next thing as well is you learn through experience and you jump into the deep end those go hand in hand when you do that and you jump into the deep end so you start forward testing live testing what will happen is you will lose you will lose you will lose remember that you will lose sooner or later you will go through a big drawdown streak where you will have a losing streak most people when they experience that drawdown when they experience that losing streak they will change strategies they what I just talked about they will see a concept on Twitter wherever that did good that week and then they will say oh yeah I need that concept so let me change my strategy don't do that because then you will be in this endless shiny object syndrome cycle again so what you want to do you want to jump into the deep end so you want to just go for it experience the losses perfect you need to lose you need to fill in order to win you fail multiple times until you win because every time you feel you get better you get stronger but you don't get better by now incorporating a whole new strategy because then the cycle just starts from zero again you only get better when you stick to the same things and do it over and over again and you feel and you feel and you feel then eventually you learn and you get better so you learn through your own experience there's not one single person in this entire world that can tell you how you should do things not one single person remember that always that is also the reason why you never want to idolize someone nobody here is a God we are all humans we are all the same but we are unique in our own separate ways when you idolize someone I truly think that you might be insecure again I'm not trying to be rude or anything but think about it essentially what you're saying is that that human being is better than you and he or she might be better at you in something but that doesn't mean you can't get better than them I hope I personally hope my students get better than me of course that's the goal if I didn't want that then I would just control you all and I would make you reliant on me when you make someone reliant on you they can never outgrow you you have them under control how do you control people how do you make them Reliant well if they idolize you that's the first step then the second thing is if you throw New Concepts at them every time and slowly all that you say is the only right thing in the world to them if you treat another man or woman their word is the only right thing that is extremely detrimental you need to form your own uniqueness you were not born on this Earth to follow someone or to idolize someone else and then again I mean idolizing another human being and that is why people don't reach their potential you need to form your own opinion about things because again that All Leads down to in trading you have a unique approach to the market everyone sees it a little bit different I can teach you certain guidelines but still you will slightly interpret it differently and that's perfect that is where your uniqueness comes in that is perfect that's nothing bad but if you're reliant on someone else's opinion always then you can't even have your own opinion you're just following someone that person is not going to be there when you take losses that person's not going to be there when you win as well it's all up to you it's all up to you to be successful no one else so don't idolize and don't rely they go hand in hand then as well when we jump into the deep end and we have found the right Mentor Etc we never change the core of our strategy you never want to change the core of your strategy never because again that leads back to the high probability conditions low probability conditions if you constantly change the strategy it's like learning something new great people like Albert Einstein Etc they didn't make great discoveries because they studied a new thing every single week they dive into a specific Niche and they study it over and over and over and that is how they make great discoveries that is the same with trading Concepts I mentioned it in an email I send out trading Concepts treat them like a tree like a tree you want to water the tree you don't want to water a new tree every time you want to water the same tree how can you ever outgrow the other trees if you're constantly going to a new tree and the old tree dies and they are going to a new tree again and the old one dies again how can you ever outgrow the other trees how can you ever outgrow your competition you can't because you're always busy trying to do something else and that's really funny because this applies in a lot of things in life shiny object syndrome is not only in trading it's huge in trading but it's also in business in business in general and seeing what you want to do because I know a lot of people that jump from Trading to e-commerce to an agency they all have shiny object syndrome and in trading you also have the shiny object syndrome where they jump now from this concept to that concept to this training plan to that trading plan never change the core of your strategy never it will pay off believe me and again all this is tied together right everything here that I'm teaching you is tied together if you were just to follow my videos all you ever did was follow my videos and you submit to time then you will be successful there's literally no way to fill literally none but if you jump from this mentor to that mentor and you're active on social media you're doing this you're doing that and you're not taking the instructions then yeah then yeah you won't be successful it's just a fact that's why a lot of people that won't watch this video they will be stuck in the same cycle over and over and over and the people that do fully watch this video I have the confidence that you will succeed right here there is always a positive lesson in everything train your brain to see it in every single little thing there's a positive lesson to take away every single thing for example if you took a loss and you had a bad trading week what's a positive lesson you grew stronger especially if you didn't mess up then you grew stronger in your mentality your psychology got stronger and if you did mess up in the form of Revenge trading over trading perfect it's also a positive lesson because you learn from it my Forex funds blowing up and not being able to trade it anymore positive lesson in everything there is a positive lesson to be found but our brains are Wired from when we were born to always seek out the negative thing but we can also always focus on positive thing that's what we want to do and again with a positive lesson I don't mean that when you take a loss you're going about how could I have avoided this loss again if the loss was in the training plan don't stress it don't worry about it Journal it and go on again journaling video will come up as well but if you take a loss and you now think how could I have avoided it maybe I need this concept maybe I need that concept talking to someone else do you have another concept or even being in Discord communities itself if you don't trade like each other then it's better to have the Discord communities muted and the reason I say that is because again no one will come to help you when you're losing the only thing they would do is they will tell you oh yes but did you see the power three did you see the macro right there and you're like oh no I I didn't see that do I need to incorporate it and they will say yeah I have the image ring plan of course you need to incorporate it and what does that do the Discord communities are just there for your shiny object syndrome to start a new cycle they are making you comfortable be uncomfortable be alone then when you have psychology issues I would advise Discord communities or to talk with someone or even send me an email and again this is all referring to when you already have a set strategy when you're ready to forward tests and you know your trading plan and then you take a loss and you go into Discord communities and they tell you A New Concept or you go into social media again all this cycle these are all things that you need to recognize that can lead to a cycle so again a positive lesson in everything but that does not mean that there's a positive lesson as in you need to change anything there's no reason to change anything submit to time when you are following my instructions here the only thing holding you back is time and that's truly I 100 believe that the only thing holding you back is time submitting to time of course means following these instructions if you submit the time but you still strategy hop so you still stratop you back test this endless cycle of back testing then yeah submitting the time you can submit for 20 years but you'll still not achieve anything so submitting to time only works if you are submitting to the right thing for example if you follow me you follow me with everything that I do with everything that I tell you then the only thing that is holding you back right now is time that's the only thing because with time your experience will grow you will see things it will make more sense your win rate will be higher your return will be higher you only submit to time so submitting to time don't Strat up that's not submitting to time learning more does not equate to making more money avoid this common mentality when you come into the SMC industry and SMC Community there's this mentality that you need to learn how an algorithm functions in order make money it's the absolute biggest there is people are too focused on trying to figure out an algorithm instead of making money all we are doing here and that's why it's called the money making team in the first place we're always focused on making money and that is exactly what we are so damn good at so if the algorithm releases its 60th PD array then just remember this video just remember what I told you so always avoid a new algorithm DLC you don't need it remember these things and there's nothing holding you back again I'm always here if you need me I want the best for you so I will always keep it real alright perfect thank you</p>

just before we start the video this episode is not for the weak people this episode will exactly be according to my plan that is filtering out the weak Traders from the strong Traders for all you strong traders that will listen to the entire thing you can treat this as a podcast there is not much going on on the screen itself nothing that will be important to you take the lessons from it and out compete your competition I hope you're ready or a life-changing lesson so today we have a very valuable video now this will not be the most fancy video a lot of people will ignore this video and the ones that do watch it will absolutely be destined for Success because this will be the most valuable lesson in the whole A to Z guide you absolutely need to hear this every single bit of it throughout this video I will touch on all the things I wanted to know before I got into trading so whenever I refer to you should do this you should do that I'm also referring to you as in you the person watching this but I'm also talking to my younger self if I knew all this and I was in the place where you were in you found the ATC guide you potentially even found the mmt the money making team then you are extremely lucky to have found that but it means nothing without the right mindset if you can combine the teachings that I have here on YouTube in the mmt and you have the right mindset then there's no reason for you not to be successful in a very short amount of time and that's why I will share this because if you can learn from this have the right mindset then believe me all it does take is time and there's nothing stopping you the only thing holding you back is time that is very important to realize and by knowing this you will accelerate your learning curve why because you are learning from my mistakes and from my experience so we will speed up your own progress now the first thing I want to mention is don't backtest never look to backtest with back testing with back testing I'm referring to using old data old charts and using the replay tool or another two and replaying the data and trying to trade it where you can just have a few clicks and you skip price for example here on gu right here you would do this and then eventually you just skip price fast fast fast fast to get to an entry this is not what you want to be doing this is going to be extremely detrimental I think we all know a backdesting warrior and what is a backdesting warrior someone that only shows up with some back testing stats every once in a while doesn't actually live trade or try to attempt to live trade all they do is constantly back their stem back they stem back test you're not going to to achieve anything by just back testing literally nothing if anything you are doing the opposite it's extremely detrimental and let me explain why back testing is making you comfortable you will never learn the emotional lessons that you need to learn in live trading in forward testing again not Financial advice but you will never learn the same emotional lessons back testing is like Tick Tock if you don't like something you swipe 20 times until you find a new video that you like within two seconds if I were to take a loss here on gu and I entered right there for example then it only takes me what is it 20 clicks to Now find a winner oh I take a loss oh let me just click a few more clicks nice now I have a winner can you see how extremely detriment that is for your psychology because in real time when you're forward testing what does that do when you take that loss you can't skip over 20 candles to take a winner so that thing that you used to do in back testing you can't do it so what is the next step if you are for testing you are going to force something or you're going to flick through other pairs other instruments and find a trait that you can potentially take and you start Revenge trading over trading because you have this habit of skipping price and trying to find the next winner to make yourself comfortable if you are in this back testing phase and in this back testing cycle because it's a cycle every time you lose a forward testing that is going to be very uncomfortable but if you're a back testing Warrior you will go back and you will back test to make yourself comfortable and to get a few dopamine hits do you see a few winners because you can just skip through price that is an extremely unhealthy habit it be uncomfortable after a loss that's normal that's a process an emotional process you need to go through if you never experience it then you will never learn you will never get better pain is there to get better from again maybe pain is a little bit of an exaggeration but it is an uncomfortable feeling losing I still lose it's not a nice feeling I don't like it I'm not going to sit here and lie about it that yes oh I love I love losing no absolutely not I hate losing I don't like it feels uncomfortable but I can acknowledge the uncomfortable feeling and I'm like alright I now feel uncomfortable I know I feel uncomfortable but there's nothing I can do about it right now it's just part of the process I'm not seeking that comfortable Feeling by going back into back testing mode extremely dangerous I would also advise there's no need to backtest at all zero reason to backtest or test an hindsight back test so only in hindsight look through your back test and then four tests be ready that you are going to lose it's going to be uncomfortable and that is very important to understand the things I've also written down here with back testing you will never experience a losing streak you will never experience the mental challenges that will come with live trading everyone can understand the technicals name someone truly this is a challenge for you truly try to name someone name someone that idiotic that can't understand the technicals there's no one in this world I refuse to believe there's anyone in this world unless you have a true mental disability but I truly believe there's no one in this world that can't understand the technicals so when that is the case it's not about technicals is it that's not why 99 feel 99 doesn't feel because they don't understand the technicals no it's not rocket science and even if it was rocket science enough people would be able to be profitable if they can understand the technicals but that's not the case 99 can't overcome their human instincts their human nature their psychology they can't control themselves they don't have self-control they fall for every trap that the market is setting out for you and I'm not talking about a liquidity trap I'm talking about the market is playing games with your mind and you are playing games with your mind and everyone around you is playing games with your mind because social media mentors throwing A New Concept at you every single week that's also something we'll touch on again always look to four tests to win eventually you need to learn through pain you need to experience pain back testing is not going to give you that pain stop back testing it's not good there are extremely unhealthy habits attached to back testing and the pros do not outweigh the cons to be honest I don't see a lot of Pros with back testing at all then the next one is follow One Mentor whoever that Mentor may be I don't care who who that Mentor is is it me is it someone else I don't really care as long as you follow that Mentor religiously now again don't idolize that is also something we will touch on in this video when you follow One Mentor you will get used to his thinking now again of course not every Mentor wants the best for you that is also and that can be extremely difficult in this trading industry so if you want to be certain if someone wants the best for you then you can notice certain characteristics in the way they teach in how they teach for example do they throw New Concepts at you every week do they tell you exactly how to apply the concepts do they show you in real time how the concepts are applied do they give you psychology lessons or is it only about the technicals all these and of course more are things to ask yourselves now does your Mentor really want the best for you and if you're in doubt you can always choose me as your Mentor because I think I fit all the criteria right there as well as the live trading which we do in the money making team because this is one of the trades right here that we were able to catch in the money making team right there all done live then the next thing is when you have that one Mentor you don't want to be active on social media because you don't want your mind to get affected by other mentors or other people telling you different things because then you activate your shiny object syndrome eventually so everything that I'm telling you here is I'm protecting you from yourself because I have been there I'm talking to myself in this video we all go through the same stages where you have a mentor but you're not really satisfied so you start looking for a new mentor and a new shiny object and something new you want something better and eventually you're just in this endless cycle and you never truly get anywhere and then your years further along the line and you never truly got anywhere and you might be in a back testing cycle where you test a New Concept every week I'm sorry but I don't have the time to do that I don't have the time to waste years on that so that is exactly why I'm giving you the lessons right here social media is truly not that relevant at all unless you're a Creator and not a consumer then I would say go for it if you're genuinely trying to help people but if you're just a consumer it's not that great you're not missing out on anything on social media truly believe me if your Mentor is on social media then again follow your Mentor but don't listen to what anyone else besides your Mentor is telling you stick to one thing only one Mentor then as well when you are going to trade and you are in your trading mode so you are forward testing you are live training whatever you are doing you don't want to be active on social media as well and the reason for that is again if you take one losing trade or you have one bad week for example then all of a sudden you see someone on Twitter Instagram another Guru mention A New Concept Etc and you get thrown off shiny object syndrome you start to doubt yourself you're insecure and then eventually it leads to this new cycle that endless shiny objection syndrome cycle so a funny thing that I actually emote out to the newsletter was that have you ever noticed that after a bad price action week or after a bad trading week where we know the majority of the people had a somewhat bad trading week have you ever noticed that on Twitter Instagram wherever usually it's Twitter because there you can influence people more directly have you ever noticed that a new fancy concept shows up it's just something to think about remember the cycle we had the trend with Turtle soups remember the macros or they're even the Reapers when did these new Concepts happen when we had absolutely shitty price action and let me tell you the reason for that is because when you have high probability conditions for your trading plan there will also be low probability conditions and in these low property conditions you just want to stay out of the market and that's difficult because that requires patience that patients that pain that uncomfortable feeling can only be acquired through four testing to through live trading not through back testing and in those low probability conditions that are low probability conditions for you that will be someone else's high probability condition again that is picking your poison you don't have to trade both pick your poison less is more in trading if you're trying to trade both that will not work so someone else will share their high probability commissions and they will say well this concept did great this week and you will think I need that concept because I did bad this week you don't need the concept you don't please listen to me you don't you will because that week was high probability the condition for that concept but then you don't take into account the low profit conditions for that concept so once you are used to that concept and you're Now using A New Concept what happens when low property conditions show up again then you will have the same cycle and you will maybe refer back to your old concept that you were using because that it was high probability in the other Concepts low probability conditions so they are inverse invertly correlated you could say you need to be conscious of that with everything you need to be conscious very conscious of everything that you're doing a lot of people don't think they don't think you need to think about things everything question everything do people want the best for you even question me do I want the best for you does Arya want the best for me is he truly helping me is he a genuine human being it's all things you need to question every single little thing think about everything it won't do your harm it will only bring you good very important so then the next thing as well is you learn through experience and you jump into the deep end those go hand in hand when you do that and you jump into the deep end so you start forward testing live testing what will happen is you will lose you will lose you will lose remember that you will lose sooner or later you will go through a big drawdown streak where you will have a losing streak most people when they experience that drawdown when they experience that losing streak they will change strategies they what I just talked about they will see a concept on Twitter wherever that did good that week and then they will say oh yeah I need that concept so let me change my strategy don't do that because then you will be in this endless shiny object syndrome cycle again so what you want to do you want to jump into the deep end so you want to just go for it experience the losses perfect you need to lose you need to fill in order to win you fail multiple times until you win because every time you feel you get better you get stronger but you don't get better by now incorporating a whole new strategy because then the cycle just starts from zero again you only get better when you stick to the same things and do it over and over again and you feel and you feel and you feel then eventually you learn and you get better so you learn through your own experience there's not one single person in this entire world that can tell you how you should do things not one single person remember that always that is also the reason why you never want to idolize someone nobody here is a God we are all humans we are all the same but we are unique in our own separate ways when you idolize someone I truly think that you might be insecure again I'm not trying to be rude or anything but think about it essentially what you're saying is that that human being is better than you and he or she might be better at you in something but that doesn't mean you can't get better than them I hope I personally hope my students get better than me of course that's the goal if I didn't want that then I would just control you all and I would make you reliant on me when you make someone reliant on you they can never outgrow you you have them under control how do you control people how do you make them Reliant well if they idolize you that's the first step then the second thing is if you throw New Concepts at them every time and slowly all that you say is the only right thing in the world to them if you treat another man or woman their word is the only right thing that is extremely detrimental you need to form your own uniqueness you were not born on this Earth to follow someone or to idolize someone else and then again I mean idolizing another human being and that is why people don't reach their potential you need to form your own opinion about things because again that All Leads down to in trading you have a unique approach to the market everyone sees it a little bit different I can teach you certain guidelines but still you will slightly interpret it differently and that's perfect that is where your uniqueness comes in that is perfect that's nothing bad but if you're reliant on someone else's opinion always then you can't even have your own opinion you're just following someone that person is not going to be there when you take losses that person's not going to be there when you win as well it's all up to you it's all up to you to be successful no one else so don't idolize and don't rely they go hand in hand then as well when we jump into the deep end and we have found the right Mentor Etc we never change the core of our strategy you never want to change the core of your strategy never because again that leads back to the high probability conditions low probability conditions if you constantly change the strategy it's like learning something new great people like Albert Einstein Etc they didn't make great discoveries because they studied a new thing every single week they dive into a specific Niche and they study it over and over and over and that is how they make great discoveries that is the same with trading Concepts I mentioned it in an email I send out trading Concepts treat them like a tree like a tree you want to water the tree you don't want to water a new tree every time you want to water the same tree how can you ever outgrow the other trees if you're constantly going to a new tree and the old tree dies and they are going to a new tree again and the old one dies again how can you ever outgrow the other trees how can you ever outgrow your competition you can't because you're always busy trying to do something else and that's really funny because this applies in a lot of things in life shiny object syndrome is not only in trading it's huge in trading but it's also in business in business in general and seeing what you want to do because I know a lot of people that jump from Trading to e-commerce to an agency they all have shiny object syndrome and in trading you also have the shiny object syndrome where they jump now from this concept to that concept to this training plan to that trading plan never change the core of your strategy never it will pay off believe me and again all this is tied together right everything here that I'm teaching you is tied together if you were just to follow my videos all you ever did was follow my videos and you submit to time then you will be successful there's literally no way to fill literally none but if you jump from this mentor to that mentor and you're active on social media you're doing this you're doing that and you're not taking the instructions then yeah then yeah you won't be successful it's just a fact that's why a lot of people that won't watch this video they will be stuck in the same cycle over and over and over and the people that do fully watch this video I have the confidence that you will succeed right here there is always a positive lesson in everything train your brain to see it in every single little thing there's a positive lesson to take away every single thing for example if you took a loss and you had a bad trading week what's a positive lesson you grew stronger especially if you didn't mess up then you grew stronger in your mentality your psychology got stronger and if you did mess up in the form of Revenge trading over trading perfect it's also a positive lesson because you learn from it my Forex funds blowing up and not being able to trade it anymore positive lesson in everything there is a positive lesson to be found but our brains are Wired from when we were born to always seek out the negative thing but we can also always focus on positive thing that's what we want to do and again with a positive lesson I don't mean that when you take a loss you're going about how could I have avoided this loss again if the loss was in the training plan don't stress it don't worry about it Journal it and go on again journaling video will come up as well but if you take a loss and you now think how could I have avoided it maybe I need this concept maybe I need that concept talking to someone else do you have another concept or even being in Discord communities itself if you don't trade like each other then it's better to have the Discord communities muted and the reason I say that is because again no one will come to help you when you're losing the only thing they would do is they will tell you oh yes but did you see the power three did you see the macro right there and you're like oh no I I didn't see that do I need to incorporate it and they will say yeah I have the image ring plan of course you need to incorporate it and what does that do the Discord communities are just there for your shiny object syndrome to start a new cycle they are making you comfortable be uncomfortable be alone then when you have psychology issues I would advise Discord communities or to talk with someone or even send me an email and again this is all referring to when you already have a set strategy when you're ready to forward tests and you know your trading plan and then you take a loss and you go into Discord communities and they tell you A New Concept or you go into social media again all this cycle these are all things that you need to recognize that can lead to a cycle so again a positive lesson in everything but that does not mean that there's a positive lesson as in you need to change anything there's no reason to change anything submit to time when you are following my instructions here the only thing holding you back is time and that's truly I 100 believe that the only thing holding you back is time submitting to time of course means following these instructions if you submit the time but you still strategy hop so you still stratop you back test this endless cycle of back testing then yeah submitting the time you can submit for 20 years but you'll still not achieve anything so submitting to time only works if you are submitting to the right thing for example if you follow me you follow me with everything that I do with everything that I tell you then the only thing that is holding you back right now is time that's the only thing because with time your experience will grow you will see things it will make more sense your win rate will be higher your return will be higher you only submit to time so submitting to time don't Strat up that's not submitting to time learning more does not equate to making more money avoid this common mentality when you come into the SMC industry and SMC Community there's this mentality that you need to learn how an algorithm functions in order make money it's the absolute biggest there is people are too focused on trying to figure out an algorithm instead of making money all we are doing here and that's why it's called the money making team in the first place we're always focused on making money and that is exactly what we are so damn good at so if the algorithm releases its 60th PD array then just remember this video just remember what I told you so always avoid a new algorithm DLC you don't need it remember these things and there's nothing holding you back again I'm always here if you need me I want the best for you so I will always keep it real alright perfect thank you
```

## <p>so today will be a huge one this video will be the highlight of the A to Z guide because we will be going everything that you need to know in order for you to trade a market maker model all the secrets all the sauce everything you can think of will be shared today and of course it's in my personal style which means that it's straight to the point and it's cutting out a lot of that you don't need the first thing that is very important to understand because I have made a list in which I go over to certain steps that we need and the first step on that list is understanding the context I believe the context is everything now what do I mean with context with context I mean that you understand where a Markov maker model will form if you can understand where a market maker model will form you can understand when order blocks will hold you can understand when certain PD arrays in the market will hold and push price higher or lower usually what you will see is that a market maker model forms only in a short period of time and what I mean by that is that the highest probability price action is not always going to be there there are certain moments in price that will be the highest probability price action will every day be high probability no will every week be high probability no will every month be high probability no it's picking out the right context in the highest probability price action and that is exactly what I'm going to show you here because that is where your Market maker model will form what I always tell people is it will feel like there will be more low probability days than there will be high probability days so when you're moving from high probability date to high probability day in between that it's patience patience for new context to form when you have the context that is where you can go crazy so on a technical level what I mean with context if we zoom out and with zooming out I mean going up in time frames the more you zoom out the easier the context will be because on a certain time frame the context is just simply moving from discount array to premium array or from premium array to Discount array depends on if we're bullish or bearish so if we take a look at this context on USD JPY on a monthly time frame now I know you've all seen this before if you've watched my previous videos you've all seen this before but this is a beautiful example and this is also going a little bit over hindsight examples but I'm also going to show you a live example which was exactly a thing we forecasted in the weekly forecast as well right here on a monthly basis we are moving from what this fair value Gap with this overlapping order block right there those are two discount arrays on the monthly timeframe so you might remember the question that I always ask myself if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from well on a monthly time frame if we are going higher we are likely going higher from this fair value Gap with that order block right there then what is our Target our first Target is what it's this high that is our first premium array eventually we can also look to Target that high but that's not relevant for now with Market maker models and understanding the context the thing that I always teach is that you don't actually need to look to the left all you need is look to the right because everything to the left here can be blurred it can become white and it doesn't make any difference zero difference all you need to know is the context which is if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from and what is our Target and that is Discount array to premium array and you can imagine because we are doing this on a monthly time frame we have a lot of price action to work with now if we combine the time frames correctly and we zoom in on this piece of price action then in two candles because this is one two in two candles alone we can know where a market maker model will form when you move from a monthly discount rate to a monthly premium array the time frame you want to be using is either a daily time frame or a four hour time frame for your Market maker model and this is the beauty because the context is just two candles you don't need a lot of candles to know what price is doing with two candles that is already my contacts so let's zoom in to the Daily time frame now you can see that on the daily time frame we have our Market maker model because moving from this discount array to that premium array right there in between that this price action that is where you want to get get involved this is your Market maker buy model and the only thing you are doing is you are trading from a discount array to the first premium array which was the monthly order block to that monthly swing High that's all it is then you can imagine if we go over context again what do we see we see the exact same thing happen on a daily time frame for example if we look at this fair value Gap right there then we can see that moving from that discount rate with the overlapping order block as well and targeting what that first premium array which is that swing High discount to premium array in between that if you combine the time frames correctly again from that discount array to that premium array right there that again is your Market maker model this is exactly what I mean when I say you're combining the time frames correct and you can see that all this price section to the left depth for a value Gap this far Valley Gap is not really that relevant the only thing relevant is alright where are we going higher from is the only thing relevant because we want to trade this expansion higher that's the highest probability and in between that price Action Moving from that monthly discount rate to the monthly premium array that is where if you can again combine the time frames correctly that is where your daily order blocks will hold that is where your daily fair value gaps will hold that is where your daily discount arrays will hold then again if you go into this from that discount rate to that premium array on a daily time frame then here if you combine the time frames correctly for example a one hour time frame that is where your one hour PD race will hold now what is the start of a marker maker model if you have the context so we're using the context from the monthly order block to the monthly premium array right there then on the daily diaphragm you would want to see an st so there is just a fair value up higher which we get right there that is already an early indication of what of the intermediate term low being confirmed now this price action right here this retracement is not as high probability as the second fair value Gap that we are creating right there this fair value Gap overlapping with that order block that is your highest probability price action that is where the fair value gaps are telling you a story and the fair Vegas are telling you yes we indeed want to go higher to Target that high right there and all that is is your new short term range so you're using the short-term ranges to get involved to Target this intermediate term high but that is a short-term high on the monthly time frame that is why combining the time frames is so important and again this being a consolidation that's not relevant that's the least of your concern the consolidation there is the least relevant all you're doing is you're targeting this intermediate term high on the time frame you are entering on so the time frame you are entering on you are targeting an intermediate term high but your context time frame is just a short-term High the same when we look at this daily Gap to the Daily swing high right there on our context time frame AKA our daily time frame right here we are moving from this fair value Gap to that just singular high so that is just a short term high but if we were to look at the one hour time frame right there what would it be of course it would be an intermediate term high and then you use the short term ranges on either the four hour the one hour to get involved to Target that intermediate term high now the funny thing is why is this context so important can you see this huge expansion that we had right there and then we had a sudden retracement on The Daily timeframe this is a scary retracement because it looks almost like we're bearish right there but all we're doing if we were looking at the monthly time frame all we're doing is coming back into a discount rate to continue knew the trend that was established on the monthly time frame and how do we know the monthly time frame wanted to go higher because the fair value gaps are telling us a story that the monthly time frame is still bullish we're just following the fair value camps there and this move is exactly what you need because after an expansion what I always talk about you don't want to chase price you want to wait for what a new retracement because what does the new retracement do it creates a new context from a new discount rate to a new premium array so don't be scared of retracements retracements are where New Market maker models will form for example here when we had this retracement a new market maker model formed when we had this retracement a new market maker model formed it's all fractal and when we do have that retracement that is exactly where you want to get involved you don't want to look at instruments that have already been expanding you want to look at the ones that have been retracing so the same exact thing when we took out that hi right there that is our Target so what do we do after first of all the fair value gaps are telling us a story right there Above This high does it seem like we are sweeping again fair value Gap is telling us a story right now it does seem like they are getting respected we are not wicking above that high we are not aggressively moving lower that is already the first indication that we might want to continue higher and Target that high now what do we need in order for us to Target that high we need new context after taking the target we've been expanding we need a retracement a retracement into what into a new discount array to Target a new premium array so we need new context what you would do after your target has been reached you zoom out zooming out again means going up in time frames you go up in time frames because if you were to use a daily time frame here it is difficult well it might not be that difficult but it's more difficult difficult to navigate than if you were to use the weekly time frame because if we take a look at the weekly time frame then we can see that it's just one simple fair value Gap right there that we are moving higher from isn't that beautiful and then the only thing you need to do is see that we can provide app and say to yourself if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from we have a weekly verify Gap there still within the monthly context we are expending higher then that discount array on a weekly basis is where we want to look for potential higher prices than that high right there is what that's our Target so between this low right there and that high akar Target this is our context again and all we're doing there all we're doing is predicting maybe one or two candles on a weekly basis and those one to two candles on a weekly basis give us a lot to work with on the lower time frame if you can understand what I'm trying to tell you here the context that is the most important part because now you know you know where order blocks will likely hold you know where breaker blocks will likely hold you know where firefighter gaps will likely hold AKA You Now know where short term ranges will likely hold because if we zoom in on this particular price action and we go into the one hour time frame then we can see that on the one hour time frame what happened after we took that Target to the left right we can see that on a one hour time frame it's very messy it's very messy and this is not above this high the first time being above that high right there all this price action this is not where your breaker block will hold where your order block will hold where your fair value get behold if anything that is what that is where price fails to follow through AKA your Seek and Destroy conditions then where will our new market maker model form if we have new context and that new context happens where when we move from a new discount array to that new premium array in between that discount rate to that premium array we will form what first an intermediate term High AKA or St that St forms where this right there that small verified that is your St that is a very early entry now is this the best entry is that the highest probability entry absolutely not I think the longer you wait the more you will get rewarded what do I mean by that the longer you wait in a market maker model of course you're not waiting until the target is hit and then getting involved but the longer you manage to wait the more patience you can have you will get reward because that will be the highest probability that will give you the highest win rate and the highest returns then right here we see it at St and what do we see after one fair value Gap two fair value gaps this is the moment where price is now confirmed to go higher because we have this new shorter term range right there afterwards what do we see short-term range right here is holding then after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range will it hold what are we close to the draw on liquidity right there now I do want to mention this when going into the lower time frame the kill zones the news drivers the day of the week they all become more important what did we mention again when does price want to expand higher when price has volatility when is their volatility in the market when there's news in the market price needs news to expand higher which is exactly the reason why you saw this low being created when on a Wednesday what was the economic calendar doing on a Wednesday we had US dollar news and afterwards we see a again US dollar news and again US dollar news so what can we expect the volatility is right at those days when the context is also there because if we're trading blindly and we're trading this we're trading in the middle of this Seek and Destroy range then obviously the news is not relevant because we don't even have context if we don't have context we have nothing to work with now the crazy thing is that even if you have just this weekly fair value Gap and this is again being way more advanced but just by having that Weekly surviving up on your chart it first off acts as a magnet and then it acts as a rocket because price will consolidate because it's seeing a weekly Fairfax right there so price will do a consolidation here and then it will have some certain setups right there because it's targeting what it's targeting the Drone liquidity which is what the weekly Fair fire cap right there and then the weekly provide access what once we reach it it acts as a rock pocket why because now it's pushing it away and you can see pushing price away the high probability days right here they are flying by they happen quick you either get in or you miss it but the low probability days again these are what I would say they are lower probability than these high probability days they happen slowly price takes its time it's moving slowly it's doing whatever it wants it is taking out the impatient Traders that's exactly what it's doing and the inpatient Traders have already lost and blown their account in this price action before they can even get to these high probability days high probability days don't happen always you need to pick them out if you follow the steps the context the news drivers if the checklist is complete that is when we have high probability days and you can probably imagine that these pair of value gaps right there what are they doing that is when we have on the lower time frame marker maker models because moving from this fair value Gap right there to that swing high right there this is exactly the same exact context as we just saw in between that low to that high this is where your short term range is on the 5 minute will hold for example if we take this piece of price action where we're moving from that order block to this High That Swing High then from this low to that high that is where your 5 minute short term ranges will hold so let's zoom in so here we are on the five minute this is our weekly fair value Gap right there we've been pushing higher and you can see that on the five minute this price action is way more difficult to navigate here's where you would use even more so the intermediate term lows the intermediate term highs and you can see that if you just just have one singular or two one hour candles that are moving from discount array to their pre-memory then the contacts on the five minute becomes so much easier for example right here we have what we have this intermediate term High then we have a retracement into what that breaker block right there this already that down candle is coming into what that breaker block with an already confirmed fair value Gap is that a perfect entry yes it is now does this need to be your target right there you can use it a sword yeah of course you can you can but keeping in mind is the RR right there worth it is that worth it a 0.44 I don't believe so so what you can do because remember we are in a weekly context because we're in a weekly context we can go even crazier and Target that whole weekly High which is sitting right there now again I want you to understand me very clearly will will these traits happen very often no usually you will see a lot of losses a lot of break evens before you get a crazy Runner like this so just aiming for a simple one to two is all that you need it's even more than you need and you can see that every single retracement that happened on the one hour this was this one hour retracement into the discount rate the fair value Gap with the overlapping breaker that is sitting right there and it was a Target That Swing high right there based on a one hour you can see on five minute this retracement is very confusing so if you just zoom out and you make it easier for yourself all you're doing is trading from that discount array to that premium rate and in between that you are using this intermediate term height that is where your St forms then after we have a new providing up higher we have this short term range these short term ranges they will hold and you use them as your entry right there all these short-term ranges are your entries and again a short-term range needs to have a fair value Gap ideally the short-term range should also come off of a previous discount array but they need to have a fair value Gap there needs to be a verified Gap in the short-term range otherwise it isn't a short-term range just to go over this one more time as well where would you place your stop loss you place your stop loss at the place where price has no reason to come back to this right here price has no reason to come back to why because this low if we look at the one hour again that low right there that is where price already came into a previous survive Gap and already created a new short-term range higher and because that we know short-term ranges will hold until we reach that intermediate term high that Weekly Target we know that price has no reason to come back there and then after this target is hit right there what would you do on a five minute time frame that's an intermediate term high but what would you do you do the same exact thing you zoom out again because when you zoom out again and we go up in time frames you can use the 50 minutes as well but if we use the one hour time frame then right here we can see we have that breaker with that overlapping fair value Gap right there we have new context and that new context if we dive into the five minute then that new context is already where our entry opportunities happen right there so would you follow price after this entry opportunity has happened right there would you follow price based on a five minute time frame higher you could do that but you need to understand that is not the highest probability that is actually pretty low probability because a lot of times you will get caught in price action like this where we come into that for Value Gap and we just have a huge retracement lower and what does it retrace into it retraces into something that is on the time frame above it because your five minute needs to be in constantly 50 minutes your 50 minute needs to be inconsistent of your one hour so when we retrace into something on the one hour you need to be aware of that if you're just following the five minute time frame right here your five main structure then you will get blindsided and you can see here that every retracement that happens don't be scared of it because it's a new opportunity it's a new market maker model even the smallest retracement if you were to trade like the second time frame the one minute time frame then this retracement right there for example if you were to go into the even lower time frame than this from that discount array to that premium array that is your context for a very low time frame Market maker model and then in between that all you're doing is what you're waiting for that intermediate term low which is your St afterwards you're waiting for new short-term ranges which is exactly the highest probability price action where you can get involved in after we reach the target what do you do you zoom out again you go up in time frames and you wait for new contacts because then right there that is your order block and this to that that is what that is your new contact and that is where you would go go into I don't know the 30 second time frame the 10 second time frame now don't make it that crazy you don't need those second time frames it's just as an example of how fractal this is because essentially what we've just done we've worked from the monthly all the way down to even a second star frame which is the exact same all you need is that context you constantly need the context the context I would argue is almost the same as your entries because when you think about it you constantly have the same contact because here we moved from this one hour or block to that one hour premium array right there Then for an entry we are moving from this five minute order block to that five minute premium array right there which is also your context and after we have reached our Target we need to ask ourselves and this is where the fair value Gap video comes in and the video I'm talking about is the fair value gaps are telling you a secret story because right here we are on Euro GBP and this is a beaut for example if we again start off with the monthly time frame that we can see that we are moving from this monthly fair value Gap two the monthly low which was first that low and afterwards this low as well which is a clear Wing low on the weekly time frame right there so if we are moving from that monthly paradig up to that Weekly low right there then on a daily time frame of course we will have nice moves and fair value gaps holding right there until we reach that low now this is where the fair value gaps are telling you a story because if we go into the four hour time frame what do we see we see that once we reach this target we have a very aggressive reaction this reaction right there based on the fair value gaps telling you a story is this a reaction and you can compare to USD JPY what we just saw is that a reaction that you would say yes I do think we are continuing lower well we could we very well could but not right now we are clearly having a very aggressive reaction and we are clearly seeing what a market maker buy model in the making we just came off of this Market maker cell model right there and now we are creating a market maker buy model what can this marker make buy model reach for this is a different scenario because now we are moving from an external range right there we are sweeping liquidity to targeting something internal internal in the form of a fair value Gap if we zoom out we first off have a few daily favor gaps sitting right there one small one right there and one right there but what you're taking into account is the weekly time frame because here on the weekly time frame we are in the middle we are 10 hours away from creating what a weekly pair value Gap what have I told you before one two three this candle is uncertain because we already had the expansion prices in for a retracement especially after reaching a Target so that fair value Gap acts as already before it's even being created that acts as a magnet or price that fair value Gap in itself is your drone liquidity the same as what we just went over on UC JPY the for Value Gap acts as a magnet and as what as potentially a rocket so if Euro GBP wants to continue lower then it will likely do it off of that Weekly for five Gap so that Weekly for flag up in itself is a Target and it could be responsible to push price lower now again that is where more knowledge as well comes in because if we're sweeping this like this currently then is it very logical for price to continue lower off of that that is something we will discuss as well in the weekly forecast so knowing that this is our draw liquidity that is the most important part right now that if we go back into the four hour then right there what are we seeing we are seeing this SD which is creating what that intermediate your term low right there Then That St is creating what that small fair value Gap right there then this small fair value gap on a four hour time frame it's what it's your new gun text because we're moving from this low to that high so if we go into the 15 minute time frame on that particular context then here we can see we here we have no provide gaps higher but afterwards what do we create we have this provide up higher and then afterwards we also have that for Value Gap higher right there these are all potential entry opportunities and what are they they are short-term ranges again after we reached this turret what Would You Do Well to avoid ugly price action like this where it's not that clear what it wants to do Etc you would zoom out and you would look at new context what is your context here when we are moving from this four hour block even death for our profile Gap right there then what we could see is this Gunnery Creamery with this weekly fair value Gap as your target as well so that is an extra that you have that is an extra drone that could get an extra Confluence so right there you can do what you use the intermediate term low which is your St then you look for your short term ranges and your fair value gaps and you target that high now again the head is not Financial advice and again that is being very aware it is also a Friday is Friday known as a trending day what did we go over with the weekly profiles Friday is generally not known as a trending day so there is something to take into account that is why all the videos combining all the videos it's very important but you can probably see now why this is the highlight of the A to Z guide and as well what you can see is after we break it all all down that you don't need those labels the labels itself are irrelevant I could call it for example I don't know banana smoothie number two banana smoothie entry number two and it would be the same all you need to do is follow a step-by-step process and the context is important that is all you're essentially doing now combining the swing grades we went over in the previous episode as well that is how you can get to certain entries and how you can get to a certain training plan that you want to use and you can see that if you're using the swing rates on the higher time frame and then also on the lower time frame you can get to very high probability price action just a little reminder that today the enrollments are open for the master class if you're interested again scan the QR code on your screen or go to wap.com or slash audio IO the enrollments will only be open for 24 hours so tomorrow they will close again if you do miss the enrollments then of course the essential class is always open for you or a lifetime package with the most class now again disclaimer will this always work no there's a step-by-step process that you are following but you still need to understand there needs to be work done on your site it's not just that I give you this and all of a sudden you have 100 win rate all of a sudden you're a millionaire no it's about finding the right context the entries are really easy you can see the entries are not the point and that is why I went over the context because if you can understand the context that is important where these Market maker model forms I always tell people in a mentorship the entry models you can click buy or sell it doesn't matter as long as you understand the context that you are trading within because it's the context that makes the trader not the entry model the entry model choose one that you like it's getting to the right context that is the most important part in finding Mark make models and in your trading and this is exactly how you can form these contacts and how it's very fractal you can make it as crazy as you want so practice practice and practice makes perfect and if you manage to actually stick to it instead of now focusing on a new video where you have a new shiny object and you're like oh let me use this then yes I have very bad news for you if you are one of those where you consistently see a new YouTube video or someone talking about something new turtle soups I don't know and now you're thinking oh yeah let me use that because it looks way better than what I currently have then I have bad news for you because you will never get out of that endless cycle of finding that new shiny object you need to stick to something and in the beginning like we discussed as well there's a losing curve you're going to lose in the beginning and if you don't lose in the beginning you will later on experience drawdown and that's where risk management also comes in so be very aware of that again enrollments are open if you did like this video I would appreciate a like turn on the notifications subscribe do whatever you feel like doing share it with your friends fans shared with anyone who needs to see this or who needs to hear this and then of course I want to invite you to the weekly forecast on Sunday if you haven't watched any other videos on the HC guide then I would highly suggest you to do so because they will help you a lot alright perfect thank you foreign [Music]</p>

so today will be a huge one this video will be the highlight of the A to Z guide because we will be going everything that you need to know in order for you to trade a market maker model all the secrets all the sauce everything you can think of will be shared today and of course it's in my personal style which means that it's straight to the point and it's cutting out a lot of that you don't need the first thing that is very important to understand because I have made a list in which I go over to certain steps that we need and the first step on that list is understanding the context I believe the context is everything now what do I mean with context with context I mean that you understand where a Markov maker model will form if you can understand where a market maker model will form you can understand when order blocks will hold you can understand when certain PD arrays in the market will hold and push price higher or lower usually what you will see is that a market maker model forms only in a short period of time and what I mean by that is that the highest probability price action is not always going to be there there are certain moments in price that will be the highest probability price action will every day be high probability no will every week be high probability no will every month be high probability no it's picking out the right context in the highest probability price action and that is exactly what I'm going to show you here because that is where your Market maker model will form what I always tell people is it will feel like there will be more low probability days than there will be high probability days so when you're moving from high probability date to high probability day in between that it's patience patience for new context to form when you have the context that is where you can go crazy so on a technical level what I mean with context if we zoom out and with zooming out I mean going up in time frames the more you zoom out the easier the context will be because on a certain time frame the context is just simply moving from discount array to premium array or from premium array to Discount array depends on if we're bullish or bearish so if we take a look at this context on USD JPY on a monthly time frame now I know you've all seen this before if you've watched my previous videos you've all seen this before but this is a beautiful example and this is also going a little bit over hindsight examples but I'm also going to show you a live example which was exactly a thing we forecasted in the weekly forecast as well right here on a monthly basis we are moving from what this fair value Gap with this overlapping order block right there those are two discount arrays on the monthly timeframe so you might remember the question that I always ask myself if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from well on a monthly time frame if we are going higher we are likely going higher from this fair value Gap with that order block right there then what is our Target our first Target is what it's this high that is our first premium array eventually we can also look to Target that high but that's not relevant for now with Market maker models and understanding the context the thing that I always teach is that you don't actually need to look to the left all you need is look to the right because everything to the left here can be blurred it can become white and it doesn't make any difference zero difference all you need to know is the context which is if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from and what is our Target and that is Discount array to premium array and you can imagine because we are doing this on a monthly time frame we have a lot of price action to work with now if we combine the time frames correctly and we zoom in on this piece of price action then in two candles because this is one two in two candles alone we can know where a market maker model will form when you move from a monthly discount rate to a monthly premium array the time frame you want to be using is either a daily time frame or a four hour time frame for your Market maker model and this is the beauty because the context is just two candles you don't need a lot of candles to know what price is doing with two candles that is already my contacts so let's zoom in to the Daily time frame now you can see that on the daily time frame we have our Market maker model because moving from this discount array to that premium array right there in between that this price action that is where you want to get get involved this is your Market maker buy model and the only thing you are doing is you are trading from a discount array to the first premium array which was the monthly order block to that monthly swing High that's all it is then you can imagine if we go over context again what do we see we see the exact same thing happen on a daily time frame for example if we look at this fair value Gap right there then we can see that moving from that discount rate with the overlapping order block as well and targeting what that first premium array which is that swing High discount to premium array in between that if you combine the time frames correctly again from that discount array to that premium array right there that again is your Market maker model this is exactly what I mean when I say you're combining the time frames correct and you can see that all this price section to the left depth for a value Gap this far Valley Gap is not really that relevant the only thing relevant is alright where are we going higher from is the only thing relevant because we want to trade this expansion higher that's the highest probability and in between that price Action Moving from that monthly discount rate to the monthly premium array that is where if you can again combine the time frames correctly that is where your daily order blocks will hold that is where your daily fair value gaps will hold that is where your daily discount arrays will hold then again if you go into this from that discount rate to that premium array on a daily time frame then here if you combine the time frames correctly for example a one hour time frame that is where your one hour PD race will hold now what is the start of a marker maker model if you have the context so we're using the context from the monthly order block to the monthly premium array right there then on the daily diaphragm you would want to see an st so there is just a fair value up higher which we get right there that is already an early indication of what of the intermediate term low being confirmed now this price action right here this retracement is not as high probability as the second fair value Gap that we are creating right there this fair value Gap overlapping with that order block that is your highest probability price action that is where the fair value gaps are telling you a story and the fair Vegas are telling you yes we indeed want to go higher to Target that high right there and all that is is your new short term range so you're using the short-term ranges to get involved to Target this intermediate term high but that is a short-term high on the monthly time frame that is why combining the time frames is so important and again this being a consolidation that's not relevant that's the least of your concern the consolidation there is the least relevant all you're doing is you're targeting this intermediate term high on the time frame you are entering on so the time frame you are entering on you are targeting an intermediate term high but your context time frame is just a short-term High the same when we look at this daily Gap to the Daily swing high right there on our context time frame AKA our daily time frame right here we are moving from this fair value Gap to that just singular high so that is just a short term high but if we were to look at the one hour time frame right there what would it be of course it would be an intermediate term high and then you use the short term ranges on either the four hour the one hour to get involved to Target that intermediate term high now the funny thing is why is this context so important can you see this huge expansion that we had right there and then we had a sudden retracement on The Daily timeframe this is a scary retracement because it looks almost like we're bearish right there but all we're doing if we were looking at the monthly time frame all we're doing is coming back into a discount rate to continue knew the trend that was established on the monthly time frame and how do we know the monthly time frame wanted to go higher because the fair value gaps are telling us a story that the monthly time frame is still bullish we're just following the fair value camps there and this move is exactly what you need because after an expansion what I always talk about you don't want to chase price you want to wait for what a new retracement because what does the new retracement do it creates a new context from a new discount rate to a new premium array so don't be scared of retracements retracements are where New Market maker models will form for example here when we had this retracement a new market maker model formed when we had this retracement a new market maker model formed it's all fractal and when we do have that retracement that is exactly where you want to get involved you don't want to look at instruments that have already been expanding you want to look at the ones that have been retracing so the same exact thing when we took out that hi right there that is our Target so what do we do after first of all the fair value gaps are telling us a story right there Above This high does it seem like we are sweeping again fair value Gap is telling us a story right now it does seem like they are getting respected we are not wicking above that high we are not aggressively moving lower that is already the first indication that we might want to continue higher and Target that high now what do we need in order for us to Target that high we need new context after taking the target we've been expanding we need a retracement a retracement into what into a new discount array to Target a new premium array so we need new context what you would do after your target has been reached you zoom out zooming out again means going up in time frames you go up in time frames because if you were to use a daily time frame here it is difficult well it might not be that difficult but it's more difficult difficult to navigate than if you were to use the weekly time frame because if we take a look at the weekly time frame then we can see that it's just one simple fair value Gap right there that we are moving higher from isn't that beautiful and then the only thing you need to do is see that we can provide app and say to yourself if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from we have a weekly verify Gap there still within the monthly context we are expending higher then that discount array on a weekly basis is where we want to look for potential higher prices than that high right there is what that's our Target so between this low right there and that high akar Target this is our context again and all we're doing there all we're doing is predicting maybe one or two candles on a weekly basis and those one to two candles on a weekly basis give us a lot to work with on the lower time frame if you can understand what I'm trying to tell you here the context that is the most important part because now you know you know where order blocks will likely hold you know where breaker blocks will likely hold you know where firefighter gaps will likely hold AKA You Now know where short term ranges will likely hold because if we zoom in on this particular price action and we go into the one hour time frame then we can see that on the one hour time frame what happened after we took that Target to the left right we can see that on a one hour time frame it's very messy it's very messy and this is not above this high the first time being above that high right there all this price action this is not where your breaker block will hold where your order block will hold where your fair value get behold if anything that is what that is where price fails to follow through AKA your Seek and Destroy conditions then where will our new market maker model form if we have new context and that new context happens where when we move from a new discount array to that new premium array in between that discount rate to that premium array we will form what first an intermediate term High AKA or St that St forms where this right there that small verified that is your St that is a very early entry now is this the best entry is that the highest probability entry absolutely not I think the longer you wait the more you will get rewarded what do I mean by that the longer you wait in a market maker model of course you're not waiting until the target is hit and then getting involved but the longer you manage to wait the more patience you can have you will get reward because that will be the highest probability that will give you the highest win rate and the highest returns then right here we see it at St and what do we see after one fair value Gap two fair value gaps this is the moment where price is now confirmed to go higher because we have this new shorter term range right there afterwards what do we see short-term range right here is holding then after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range will it hold what are we close to the draw on liquidity right there now I do want to mention this when going into the lower time frame the kill zones the news drivers the day of the week they all become more important what did we mention again when does price want to expand higher when price has volatility when is their volatility in the market when there's news in the market price needs news to expand higher which is exactly the reason why you saw this low being created when on a Wednesday what was the economic calendar doing on a Wednesday we had US dollar news and afterwards we see a again US dollar news and again US dollar news so what can we expect the volatility is right at those days when the context is also there because if we're trading blindly and we're trading this we're trading in the middle of this Seek and Destroy range then obviously the news is not relevant because we don't even have context if we don't have context we have nothing to work with now the crazy thing is that even if you have just this weekly fair value Gap and this is again being way more advanced but just by having that Weekly surviving up on your chart it first off acts as a magnet and then it acts as a rocket because price will consolidate because it's seeing a weekly Fairfax right there so price will do a consolidation here and then it will have some certain setups right there because it's targeting what it's targeting the Drone liquidity which is what the weekly Fair fire cap right there and then the weekly provide access what once we reach it it acts as a rock pocket why because now it's pushing it away and you can see pushing price away the high probability days right here they are flying by they happen quick you either get in or you miss it but the low probability days again these are what I would say they are lower probability than these high probability days they happen slowly price takes its time it's moving slowly it's doing whatever it wants it is taking out the impatient Traders that's exactly what it's doing and the inpatient Traders have already lost and blown their account in this price action before they can even get to these high probability days high probability days don't happen always you need to pick them out if you follow the steps the context the news drivers if the checklist is complete that is when we have high probability days and you can probably imagine that these pair of value gaps right there what are they doing that is when we have on the lower time frame marker maker models because moving from this fair value Gap right there to that swing high right there this is exactly the same exact context as we just saw in between that low to that high this is where your short term range is on the 5 minute will hold for example if we take this piece of price action where we're moving from that order block to this High That Swing High then from this low to that high that is where your 5 minute short term ranges will hold so let's zoom in so here we are on the five minute this is our weekly fair value Gap right there we've been pushing higher and you can see that on the five minute this price action is way more difficult to navigate here's where you would use even more so the intermediate term lows the intermediate term highs and you can see that if you just just have one singular or two one hour candles that are moving from discount array to their pre-memory then the contacts on the five minute becomes so much easier for example right here we have what we have this intermediate term High then we have a retracement into what that breaker block right there this already that down candle is coming into what that breaker block with an already confirmed fair value Gap is that a perfect entry yes it is now does this need to be your target right there you can use it a sword yeah of course you can you can but keeping in mind is the RR right there worth it is that worth it a 0.44 I don't believe so so what you can do because remember we are in a weekly context because we're in a weekly context we can go even crazier and Target that whole weekly High which is sitting right there now again I want you to understand me very clearly will will these traits happen very often no usually you will see a lot of losses a lot of break evens before you get a crazy Runner like this so just aiming for a simple one to two is all that you need it's even more than you need and you can see that every single retracement that happened on the one hour this was this one hour retracement into the discount rate the fair value Gap with the overlapping breaker that is sitting right there and it was a Target That Swing high right there based on a one hour you can see on five minute this retracement is very confusing so if you just zoom out and you make it easier for yourself all you're doing is trading from that discount array to that premium rate and in between that you are using this intermediate term height that is where your St forms then after we have a new providing up higher we have this short term range these short term ranges they will hold and you use them as your entry right there all these short-term ranges are your entries and again a short-term range needs to have a fair value Gap ideally the short-term range should also come off of a previous discount array but they need to have a fair value Gap there needs to be a verified Gap in the short-term range otherwise it isn't a short-term range just to go over this one more time as well where would you place your stop loss you place your stop loss at the place where price has no reason to come back to this right here price has no reason to come back to why because this low if we look at the one hour again that low right there that is where price already came into a previous survive Gap and already created a new short-term range higher and because that we know short-term ranges will hold until we reach that intermediate term high that Weekly Target we know that price has no reason to come back there and then after this target is hit right there what would you do on a five minute time frame that's an intermediate term high but what would you do you do the same exact thing you zoom out again because when you zoom out again and we go up in time frames you can use the 50 minutes as well but if we use the one hour time frame then right here we can see we have that breaker with that overlapping fair value Gap right there we have new context and that new context if we dive into the five minute then that new context is already where our entry opportunities happen right there so would you follow price after this entry opportunity has happened right there would you follow price based on a five minute time frame higher you could do that but you need to understand that is not the highest probability that is actually pretty low probability because a lot of times you will get caught in price action like this where we come into that for Value Gap and we just have a huge retracement lower and what does it retrace into it retraces into something that is on the time frame above it because your five minute needs to be in constantly 50 minutes your 50 minute needs to be inconsistent of your one hour so when we retrace into something on the one hour you need to be aware of that if you're just following the five minute time frame right here your five main structure then you will get blindsided and you can see here that every retracement that happens don't be scared of it because it's a new opportunity it's a new market maker model even the smallest retracement if you were to trade like the second time frame the one minute time frame then this retracement right there for example if you were to go into the even lower time frame than this from that discount array to that premium array that is your context for a very low time frame Market maker model and then in between that all you're doing is what you're waiting for that intermediate term low which is your St afterwards you're waiting for new short-term ranges which is exactly the highest probability price action where you can get involved in after we reach the target what do you do you zoom out again you go up in time frames and you wait for new contacts because then right there that is your order block and this to that that is what that is your new contact and that is where you would go go into I don't know the 30 second time frame the 10 second time frame now don't make it that crazy you don't need those second time frames it's just as an example of how fractal this is because essentially what we've just done we've worked from the monthly all the way down to even a second star frame which is the exact same all you need is that context you constantly need the context the context I would argue is almost the same as your entries because when you think about it you constantly have the same contact because here we moved from this one hour or block to that one hour premium array right there Then for an entry we are moving from this five minute order block to that five minute premium array right there which is also your context and after we have reached our Target we need to ask ourselves and this is where the fair value Gap video comes in and the video I'm talking about is the fair value gaps are telling you a secret story because right here we are on Euro GBP and this is a beaut for example if we again start off with the monthly time frame that we can see that we are moving from this monthly fair value Gap two the monthly low which was first that low and afterwards this low as well which is a clear Wing low on the weekly time frame right there so if we are moving from that monthly paradig up to that Weekly low right there then on a daily time frame of course we will have nice moves and fair value gaps holding right there until we reach that low now this is where the fair value gaps are telling you a story because if we go into the four hour time frame what do we see we see that once we reach this target we have a very aggressive reaction this reaction right there based on the fair value gaps telling you a story is this a reaction and you can compare to USD JPY what we just saw is that a reaction that you would say yes I do think we are continuing lower well we could we very well could but not right now we are clearly having a very aggressive reaction and we are clearly seeing what a market maker buy model in the making we just came off of this Market maker cell model right there and now we are creating a market maker buy model what can this marker make buy model reach for this is a different scenario because now we are moving from an external range right there we are sweeping liquidity to targeting something internal internal in the form of a fair value Gap if we zoom out we first off have a few daily favor gaps sitting right there one small one right there and one right there but what you're taking into account is the weekly time frame because here on the weekly time frame we are in the middle we are 10 hours away from creating what a weekly pair value Gap what have I told you before one two three this candle is uncertain because we already had the expansion prices in for a retracement especially after reaching a Target so that fair value Gap acts as already before it's even being created that acts as a magnet or price that fair value Gap in itself is your drone liquidity the same as what we just went over on UC JPY the for Value Gap acts as a magnet and as what as potentially a rocket so if Euro GBP wants to continue lower then it will likely do it off of that Weekly for five Gap so that Weekly for flag up in itself is a Target and it could be responsible to push price lower now again that is where more knowledge as well comes in because if we're sweeping this like this currently then is it very logical for price to continue lower off of that that is something we will discuss as well in the weekly forecast so knowing that this is our draw liquidity that is the most important part right now that if we go back into the four hour then right there what are we seeing we are seeing this SD which is creating what that intermediate your term low right there Then That St is creating what that small fair value Gap right there then this small fair value gap on a four hour time frame it's what it's your new gun text because we're moving from this low to that high so if we go into the 15 minute time frame on that particular context then here we can see we here we have no provide gaps higher but afterwards what do we create we have this provide up higher and then afterwards we also have that for Value Gap higher right there these are all potential entry opportunities and what are they they are short-term ranges again after we reached this turret what Would You Do Well to avoid ugly price action like this where it's not that clear what it wants to do Etc you would zoom out and you would look at new context what is your context here when we are moving from this four hour block even death for our profile Gap right there then what we could see is this Gunnery Creamery with this weekly fair value Gap as your target as well so that is an extra that you have that is an extra drone that could get an extra Confluence so right there you can do what you use the intermediate term low which is your St then you look for your short term ranges and your fair value gaps and you target that high now again the head is not Financial advice and again that is being very aware it is also a Friday is Friday known as a trending day what did we go over with the weekly profiles Friday is generally not known as a trending day so there is something to take into account that is why all the videos combining all the videos it's very important but you can probably see now why this is the highlight of the A to Z guide and as well what you can see is after we break it all all down that you don't need those labels the labels itself are irrelevant I could call it for example I don't know banana smoothie number two banana smoothie entry number two and it would be the same all you need to do is follow a step-by-step process and the context is important that is all you're essentially doing now combining the swing grades we went over in the previous episode as well that is how you can get to certain entries and how you can get to a certain training plan that you want to use and you can see that if you're using the swing rates on the higher time frame and then also on the lower time frame you can get to very high probability price action just a little reminder that today the enrollments are open for the master class if you're interested again scan the QR code on your screen or go to wap.com or slash audio IO the enrollments will only be open for 24 hours so tomorrow they will close again if you do miss the enrollments then of course the essential class is always open for you or a lifetime package with the most class now again disclaimer will this always work no there's a step-by-step process that you are following but you still need to understand there needs to be work done on your site it's not just that I give you this and all of a sudden you have 100 win rate all of a sudden you're a millionaire no it's about finding the right context the entries are really easy you can see the entries are not the point and that is why I went over the context because if you can understand the context that is important where these Market maker model forms I always tell people in a mentorship the entry models you can click buy or sell it doesn't matter as long as you understand the context that you are trading within because it's the context that makes the trader not the entry model the entry model choose one that you like it's getting to the right context that is the most important part in finding Mark make models and in your trading and this is exactly how you can form these contacts and how it's very fractal you can make it as crazy as you want so practice practice and practice makes perfect and if you manage to actually stick to it instead of now focusing on a new video where you have a new shiny object and you're like oh let me use this then yes I have very bad news for you if you are one of those where you consistently see a new YouTube video or someone talking about something new turtle soups I don't know and now you're thinking oh yeah let me use that because it looks way better than what I currently have then I have bad news for you because you will never get out of that endless cycle of finding that new shiny object you need to stick to something and in the beginning like we discussed as well there's a losing curve you're going to lose in the beginning and if you don't lose in the beginning you will later on experience drawdown and that's where risk management also comes in so be very aware of that again enrollments are open if you did like this video I would appreciate a like turn on the notifications subscribe do whatever you feel like doing share it with your friends fans shared with anyone who needs to see this or who needs to hear this and then of course I want to invite you to the weekly forecast on Sunday if you haven't watched any other videos on the HC guide then I would highly suggest you to do so because they will help you a lot alright perfect thank you foreign [Music]

## <p>all right welcome back daily profiles we touched on weekly profiles now we are going to be touching on daily profiles now just a heads up this daily profile video will be about Forex I will make a separate one so the next video will be a separate video where we talk about daily profiles on the indices so es NASDAQ ym Etc because it's a little bit different the basic premise behind it is the same though so you will also benefit off of watching Forex if you are a future Trader and if you are a Forex Trader you will also benefit off of that indices video so don't ignore it but just know we will have a separate video on Forex and indices because otherwise I feel like it will be overwhelming and all over the place and that's not in line with our goal here because we are here to have everything structured in a simple manner so daily profiles so first off we need to of course understand the times of the kill zones the kill zones are generally where we see volatility in the market they are Market sessions so during those times is when we expect volatility and of course like I said in a previous episode the day we expect volatility is the day when we have the economic calendar on our site that is important to understand so the economic calendar is in my opinion it is stronger than the kill zones so what do I mean by that I mean that the kill zones are nice they are nice to have an indication of when to trade for example I'm a London Trader not because London is the best moves not because London has the most volatility no because I like to trade London I like trade in the morning that London is the morning for me so I like to trade in the morning and then afterwards I like to be done for the day so let me go over a trade I actually took on EU right here so if we take a look at the daily we came into this daily fair value Gap now right here it is essential if you haven't watched the previous episode on the weekly profile please watch that because I go over the economic calendar in a price action and economic calendar needs to be in harmony now what do I mean when I say that we came into the daily fifth Valley gap on a Tuesday or short on a Monday on Tuesday and on the Wednesday and which they decided to expand Wednesday why take a look at your economic calendar and that is how I avoided losses on Monday and Tuesday I took a winner on Wednesday so right here what did my trade look like my trade was Asia session low sweep right there we swept those Asia lows then we expanded higher now what do I mean by this we had a fair value Gap a higher right there that is what I wanted to see because if we have a fair value higher in this leg then I wouldn't expect these lows to get taken or to get swept so New York was a bit of consolidation then we expanded higher off of news as well and then eventually we hit the target which was that high right there so let's break this down into an easier manner applying the daily profiles all right if we look at the Asus session when is the AC session it is from 8 until midnight open so 20 until midnight open right there zero zero zero zero that is all in New York EST New York local time so I have set at the bottom right I have my time zone set to New York for trading view why well because all the times all the kill zones or the sessions inside trading they are revolving around New York local time so generally that is a misunderstood thing because a lot of people think London session or London Killzone is actually London opening it is not London opening it is an algorithm that opens at that time so summer and winter time that doesn't matter it will always refer to New York local time so if London is now in winter time and London moved one hour back then we wouldn't change the London Kill Zone it would stay the exact same because the algorithm always refers to New York local time so London close London kill zone is always referring to the same times based off of New York local time same for Asia the Asia session doesn't change it is always referring to New York local time let's dive into daily profile so Asia again eight until zero zero AKA midnight open New York midnight open is always at zero zero zero zero then we have London London is 2 am to 5 a.m then we have New York New York is 7 A.M until 10 a.m then a London close is 10 a.m until 12 a.m and then afterwards we start a new day and we start Asia again London again New York again London close again Etc now there are different characteristics of each individual session right here the normal premise Behind These kill zones are Asian range consolidation London sweep of Asia low or Asia High depending on the high time frame bias that we have London makes a low of the day New York retraces into what London created and then expense and then London close makes the high of the day or somewhat the high of the day that is a basic premise behind everything you also have New York reverse you will also see sometimes Asia making the low or the high of the day there are different characteristics for different circumstances how can we know which circumstance will play out by knowing the higher time frame and by reacting to what price is doing simple as that it is as simple as that so for example let me guide you through this trade again right here we had a perfect Asia consolidation Asia lows are getting swept right there keeping in mind we have this daily backup I'm not just trading off of the 15 minute here I'm trading a daily continuation so London creates a fair value Gap whenever London makes a low and creates a fair value Gap so London has a fair value Gap in it New York will likely only be a retracement and won't take out what London has created will likely only be retraced and then a continuation of what London already had established that is a big Point what will London clothes do London close is meant to distribute positions that are there so what does that mean it means that London clothes will take profit it will take profit at what at a liquidity Point remember from the First episodes we need liquidity from someone else so in this case where is liquidity see these equal highs their liquidity so what happens we have a slight retracement right there and London close creates somewhat of a high now generally you don't want to be taking Longs anymore in London close you either want to be involved in London or New York but London clothes is not necessarily where you want to be taking new long if this was a bearish day then London close might be a great opportunity for lungs just like we had a bullish day here this might be a great opportunity for taking short right there on the even lower time frame a little scalp you could say and that's the same with what we just talked about on the weekly profile Thank God It's Friday setups this is your Thursday and Friday right there and you can see the Thursday and Friday right here caps to week and then we have we can we can say we started next week right here we have a Monday and Tuesday expansion again so the Thank God It's Friday setup is right here this move until we rebalance something inside that range again overlapping with what this high is breaker and then we continue higher so you can see that the same characteristic that we had on the weekly profile are actually applicable to the Daily profile as well why because we have Monday your consolidation Tuesday Wednesday and your Thursday and Friday right here so my trade just to show you what's inside this London covering the London lows right there aiming for those highs right there that was my trade all right let's give you another example of this week's price action all right right here we are on Au AKA Australian dollar US dollar now by the way the indicator that I'm using is FX Market sessions by Boy Toki I'm sorry if I mispronounced that that is the indicator that I'm using for this of course I've customized it to my own needs right here I have another indicator as you can see but that is a volume indicator why did I add this it is if I only have this indicator then this is constantly showing and it's pretty annoying to me so that's why I have another indicator right there so that is the indicator that I'm using but I normally I don't have any indicators on my chart and the reason being once you have the indicators actually integrated into your brain you're doing this every single day then you will automatically know if it's London if it's Asia if it's New York Etc your brain will pick up on it you don't need to worry about anymore I don't have the sessions on my chart anymore so what can we see here this is not your typical daily profile is it and this is why it's important understanding the daily profiles the same as the weekly profiles it is not a thing set in stone what do I mean by that you have to react you have to be able to react in this game that we call trading so for example there are certain characteristics still because the certain characteristics that are important here is do we have fair value gaps in the lag lower do we have expansions already from previous sessions and if we already come into a premium rate so for example right here I was looking at AU and Au came into this daily for Value Gap and we could Target a weekly fair value Gap that was sitting right there so on The Daily we are coming into that daily verify gap on the 15 minute what does that look like we have Asia session coming into that daily feather Gap already an Asia session already this place is lower what is the displacement a displacement is a fair value Gap we already have fair value gaps lower can we now logically expect London to take out Asia and then continue lower no absolutely not what we could expect here is like what happened London either retraces and then expands lower but London had no energy anymore to do it so what happened was London retraces right there and then eventually New York continues lower and this is where you have to react because in London there won't be a great setup here if you want to write the expansion again you have to get involved right here in New York and this was a very very clean setup actually and again at the end of New York there's a small setup but right here once we are aiming for these lows you don't generally want to get in anymore not in London close because then you will see price action like this as well and then eventually again same story Asia has that expansion also because Australian dollar is of course more so than Asia pair it is pretty volatile in Asia so you will see a lot more volatility in Asia and during Asia so that's something to be aware of that when you are trading Australian dollar US dollar for example you won't always see the perfectly clean Asia consolidation and the sweep in London Etc no that will not always happen but that doesn't mean it's not tradable because this is very much tradable right here same for this this is very much tradable well once we have reached that Weekly fair value Gap it's of course different story but this is still very much tradable the only thing that changes now is that this this high is now protected and we wouldn't expect this High to get taken out now if this High didn't come into the daily cup just yet and had no displacement it would have been a different story as well but this High came into the Daily 4 backup already displaced lower and then we continued lower in New York eventually so you could even say right that this is your Asia right here London made the high of the week looking at displacement New York had the retracement and the expansion again and London close made the load there the sessions change but the story stays the same right it is constantly consolidation sweep expansion retracement expansion let me consolidation sweep AKA your manipulation expansion to the intended Direction how can we know the internal Direction because of the higher time frame bias then we have a retracement a retracement into what a retracement into some form of value Gap order blocks it is that internal move that we talked about and then what we have the expansion again we want to get involved in that internal move so in a move right here in this New York that is where we want to get involved because then we can write the expansion again that is important to understand so again what is needed here again it is important to understand there's nothing set in stone there are certain characteristics but right here for the daily profile and again we will go into it deeper as well later on after the indices daily profiles we will dive into it deeper again but right here we need to understand the higher time frame first once we have a higher time frame established bias then we can focus on the kill zones on The Daily profile the most important is again that higher time frame that will lead you to your daily profile Etc so let me give you another example all right here we are on GBP US dollar AKA gu AKA cable so here we have a daily fair value Gap again this is also a trade that I took now here we are going to be looking at a New York reversal so you usually have either your London Hive today or low today of course in a bearish day you would expect a high of the day to be made in London or in New York now how can we know it will happen in New York when we dive into the 50 minute and again it is not that difficult to know if it will happen in New York because all we have to do is react so what can we see here we have Asia we have London expansion it actually sweeps Asia low sweeps Asia highs right there but it doesn't create the hive today doesn't create the low today well sorry it actually created the low of the day right here but eventually this is getting taken out to Target these loads of course but right here the main premise is that London didn't make the hive today and New York didn't respect what London did Etc why not how did I know at the time that this wouldn't get respected was it because Asia was a consolidation right there and we knew it it was Asia so we know Asia needs to get swept Etc no it was based off of which session which Killzone sweeps into that daily for Value Gap AKA comes into that daily for Value Gap and then this place is lower that is all that is how I knew it and London did it come into the daily figure no did Asia come into the daily for Vega no so which session or Killzone will likely come in New York what does that create a New York reversal of course this is your hive today that New York right here high of the day New York expands lower and right there that is where I got involved right there that was my entry covering the high and then aiming for new lows right there ahead of the day I can have a great indication of which session will likely come into the daily Fair Gap and then expand lower again this doesn't have to be a daily for Vega can also be a four hour premium array can also be a weekly premium rate whatever can also be even a one hour premium or discount array ahead of the day I can get a great indication because I can see where we are currently hovering so for example in the evening I do an analysis in the evening right here this is around the evening for me then during this time I'm sleeping right here I wake up I can see all right we are now here London is a great opportunity and that is already what I knew when I did my analysis in the evening I already knew all right we are pretty close to the Daily fair value Gap so London could indeed come into the daily for fire gap and then expand lower London expanded lower without coming into the daily Vega there was no trade for me London had a retracement right there and then what New York came into the daily for Vega what does that make your New York reversal it's reacting this game is all about reacting and adapting when this happened that is exactly because I just told you I mainly I'm primarily a London Trader that is exactly when I will focus on New York because New York came into the daily flag and New York expanded lower and then eventually same story London close Etc and then the next day what did we see we had Asia again Asia already had an expansion if Asia already has an expansion and a fair value Gap in the leg can we expect London right here to come all the way higher above Asia and then continue lower no that is not logical now what is the difference I can already hear you asking what is the difference between this entry for example because this could have been an entry very very great entry right there what is the difference between this entry and this entry for example in this for Value Gap or even higher you waited for it to come right here and today what is the difference well then we have to go back to the foundation what is the foundation between our traits daily Gap so we need a higher time frame context first daily 5 Gap where gets a markup maker cell model AKA a cell program gets activated where once we hit an higher time frame premium array what are we targeting when we hit in higher time from premium rate and higher time frame discount rate what is the higher time frame discount array here it is this swing low that is the first higher time for discount rate so on a 15 minute basis what do we see this is just a continuation because we already came off of Premium array on the higher time frame right there this is your continuation until we reach that discount array so it's different because this has not yet came into an higher time frame premium array and again Mark Omega models that is something we will get into so stay tuned alright so again inices is something we will discuss as well in a different video in the next video actually again if you're trading Forex the indices video will also be beneficial for you because it is the same premise but I might have a little different Insight I might explain it a little bit differently and that might make it click even more for you so it's very important to understand and watch every episode again you will not understand it by me just telling you it and watching Netflix after because then this is simply just entertainment for you if you want this to be education you need to start to apply it and you need to send me chart examples maybe even send me all your chart examples on an Instagram or a Twitter but not in DM send me it on a timeline so you actually tweet something you do a markup and tag me in that tweet or you actually place a story on your Instagram and you tag me in that story because DMS are blooded they are all over the place currently so once you actually tweet it to me or actually send me your story then I will notice it way quicker alright so if you want to do that send me your markups I will review them and I will see you at the live stream on Sunday 8 30 a.m New York local time perfect thank you

what is the displacement a displacement is a fair value Gap we already have fair value gaps lower can we now logically expect London to take out Asia and then continue lower no absolutely not what we could expect here is like what happened London either retraces and then expands lower but London had no energy anymore to do it so what happened was London retraces right there and then eventually New York continues lower and this is where you have to react because in London there won't be a great setup here if you want to write the expansion again you have to get involved right here in New York and this was a very very clean setup actually and again at the end of New York there's a small setup but right here once we are aiming for these lows you don't generally want to get in anymore not in London close because then you will see price action like this as well and then eventually again same story Asia has that expansion also because Australian dollar is of course more so than Asia pair it is pretty volatile in Asia so you will see a lot more volatility in Asia and during Asia so that's something to be aware of that when you are trading Australian dollar US dollar for example you won't always see the perfectly clean Asia consolidation and the sweep in London Etc no that will not always happen but that doesn't mean it's not tradable because this is very much tradable right here same for this this is very much tradable well once we have reached that Weekly fair value Gap it's of course different story but this is still very much tradable the only thing that changes now is that this this high is now protected and we wouldn't expect this High to get taken out now if this High didn't come into the daily cup just yet and had no displacement it would have been a different story as well but this High came into the Daily 4 backup already displaced lower and then we continued lower in New York eventually so you could even say right that this is your Asia right here London made the high of the week looking at displacement New York had the retracement and the expansion again and London close made the load there the sessions change but the story stays the same right it is constantly consolidation sweep expansion retracement expansion let me consolidation sweep AKA your manipulation expansion to the intended Direction how can we know the internal Direction because of the higher time frame bias then we have a retracement a retracement into what a retracement into some form of value Gap order blocks it is that internal move that we talked about and then what we have the expansion again we want to get involved in that internal move so in a move right here in this New York that is where we want to get involved because then we can write the expansion again that is important to understand so again what is needed here again it is important to understand there's nothing set in stone there are certain characteristics but right here for the daily profile and again we will go into it deeper as well later on after the indices daily profiles we will dive into it deeper again but right here we need to understand the higher time frame first once we have a higher time frame established bias then we can focus on the kill zones on The Daily profile the most important is again that higher time frame that will lead you to your daily profile Etc so let me give you another example all right here we are on GBP US dollar AKA gu AKA cable so here we have a daily fair value Gap again this is also a trade that I took now here we are going to be looking at a New York reversal so you usually have either your London Hive today or low today of course in a bearish day you would expect a high of the day to be made in London or in New York now how can we know it will happen in New York when we dive into the 50 minute and again it is not that difficult to know if it will happen in New York because all we have to do is react so what can we see here we have Asia we have London expansion it actually sweeps Asia low sweeps Asia highs right there but it doesn't create the hive today doesn't create the low today well sorry it actually created the low of the day right here but eventually this is getting taken out to Target these loads of course but right here the main premise is that London didn't make the hive today and New York didn't respect what London did Etc why not how did I know at the time that this wouldn't get respected was it because Asia was a consolidation right there and we knew it it was Asia so we know Asia needs to get swept Etc no it was based off of which session which Killzone sweeps into that daily for Value Gap AKA comes into that daily for Value Gap and then this place is lower that is all that is how I knew it and London did it come into the daily figure no did Asia come into the daily for Vega no so which session or Killzone will likely come in New York what does that create a New York reversal of course this is your hive today that New York right here high of the day New York expands lower and right there that is where I got involved right there that was my entry covering the high and then aiming for new lows right there ahead of the day I can have a great indication of which session will likely come into the daily Fair Gap and then expand lower again this doesn't have to be a daily for Vega can also be a four hour premium array can also be a weekly premium rate whatever can also be even a one hour premium or discount array ahead of the day I can get a great indication because I can see where we are currently hovering so for example in the evening I do an analysis in the evening right here this is around the evening for me then during this time I'm sleeping right here I wake up I can see all right we are now here London is a great opportunity and that is already what I knew when I did my analysis in the evening I already knew all right we are pretty close to the Daily fair value Gap so London could indeed come into the daily for fire gap and then expand lower London expanded lower without coming into the daily Vega there was no trade for me London had a retracement right there and then what New York came into the daily for Vega what does that make your New York reversal it's reacting this game is all about reacting and adapting when this happened that is exactly because I just told you I mainly I'm primarily a London Trader that is exactly when I will focus on New York because New York came into the daily flag and New York expanded lower and then eventually same story London close Etc and then the next day what did we see we had Asia again Asia already had an expansion if Asia already has an expansion and a fair value Gap in the leg can we expect London right here to come all the way higher above Asia and then continue lower no that is not logical now what is the difference I can already hear you asking what is the difference between this entry for example because this could have been an entry very very great entry right there what is the difference between this entry and this entry for example in this for Value Gap or even higher you waited for it to come right here and today what is the difference well then we have to go back to the foundation what is the foundation between our traits daily Gap so we need a higher time frame context first daily 5 Gap where gets a markup maker cell model AKA a cell program gets activated where once we hit an higher time frame premium array what are we targeting when we hit in higher time from premium rate and higher time frame discount rate what is the higher time frame discount array here it is this swing low that is the first higher time for discount rate so on a 15 minute basis what do we see this is just a continuation because we already came off of Premium array on the higher time frame right there this is your continuation until we reach that discount array so it's different because this has not yet came into an higher time frame premium array and again Mark Omega models that is something we will get into so stay tuned alright so again inices is something we will discuss as well in a different video in the next video actually again if you're trading Forex the indices video will also be beneficial for you because it is the same premise but I might have a little different Insight I might explain it a little bit differently and that might make it click even more for you so it's very important to understand and watch every episode again you will not understand it by me just telling you it and watching Netflix after because then this is simply just entertainment for you if you want this to be education you need to start to apply it and you need to send me chart examples maybe even send me all your chart examples on an Instagram or a Twitter but not in DM send me it on a timeline so you actually tweet something you do a markup and tag me in that tweet or you actually place a story on your Instagram and you tag me in that story because DMS are blooded they are all over the place currently so once you actually tweet it to me or actually send me your story then I will notice it way quicker alright so if you want to do that send me your markups I will review them and I will see you at the live stream on Sunday 8 30 a.m New York local time perfect thank you

## <p>inter-market analysis correlated assets how can we choose the best pair or the best instrument to trade that is exactly what we are going to be touching on here today inside my mentorship we have something called the filtering process now the filtering process is even more in-depth but right here I will show you the basics of it which is very crucial to get to an instrument to get to a pair that you want to trade most gloss enrollments open up tomorrow and they close again on Monday so that is next Monday to open up on 17th of June and they close again at the end of Monday so that is 19th of June in July enrollments will not open up again so if you want to be there be there now so intermarket analysis how can we actually get started with it and what actually is it I like to view it as a fundamental view of the entire market so you know you have a brief idea of what the entire Market is doing this way we take into account as well interest rates Etc on a technical basis but also on a fundamental basis now we get our fundamental analysis off of the chart so we don't need to look at news releases at the economic data we can get all the data all the fundamental data that we need through the chart that is absolutely beautiful and there is a very interesting part of trading as well so let's start off with how should the market actually move of course it will not always move like this but this is the highest probability if the market moves like this then that is the highest probability condition that you will have in the market right here you can see we are on the ticker zb1 that is the continuous contract The Continuous future contract of the 30-year treasury bond the 30-year treasury bond is the one I will be referring to mostly you also have the 10 year treasury month and a 5 year 30 month but we are going to be focusing on a 30-year treasury bond right here so for the 30-year treasury bond it is important to understand that the 30-year treasury bond is inversely correlated to the dollar so this will likely do the opposite of the dollar and if the dollar is going higher then what does that mean interest rates are going higher inflation is rising so the bonds are decreasing if the bonds are going higher interest rates are dropping the dollars going lower inflation is dropping so they are inversely correlated now sometimes you will see especially in this year we have had a lot of consolidation inside the 30-year treasury bond when this happens it usually is decoupled from the dollar what does this mean decoupled decoupled means when two correlated assets are not moving as they should be so they are not in sync anymore if the dollar is going higher bonds should be going lower when this isn't happening and the bonds are going higher and the dollar is going higher as well they are decoupled there's no sink in the market there's no coupling this already indicates a lower probability condition and that we might see a Seek and Destroy condition again seek in the short conditions and trending conditions is something we will get in to as well now what this indicates is usually that there is some consolidation coming when we have a decoupled market sooner or later there will be some form of consolidation now how can we actually know this beforehand by the seek and historic conditions and that again is something we will get into and of course if you thought this through then if these markets are decoupled and the bonds are moving higher and we are expecting higher price of the bonds because we do our analysis first on the bonds and then afterwards we also go into the dollar and we are also on a technical standpoint we are also expecting a higher price on the dollar then what does that indicate 50 50 bias you can't get to a clear draw liquidity when the markets are decoupled and that is also a low probability conditions is also something we will get into so just more of the story right here if the fonts are moving a higher dollar should be moving lower ideally if the bonds are moving lower dollar should be moving higher now what does this indicate for the rest of the market let's talk about Forex so foreign currencies every currency besides the US dollar if the US dollar is moving higher the foreign currencies should be moving lower they are also inversely correlated why is this dollar is the world Reserve currency everything currently is based around the dollar it has a lot of influence it is currently the biggest economy now of course with how the world is changing Etc that might change at a certain point I think China is catching up as well but again that is not that relevant currently and indices as well they are moving opposite of the dollar so also inversely correlate so bonds higher dollar lower foreign currencies higher inices higher that is the general rule of thumb now just to give you a quick insight into what I do when the bonds are consolidating and they have been consolidating a lot throughout the year I do tend to take the bonds less into account so I will mainly go over the dollar and then the foreign currencies or the indices those are still very important but the bonds have been consolidating quite a while throughout this year and that may explain price action throughout the year as well because when this happens it is still lower probability and if you wear around in last summer this price action was absolutely beautiful almost at the end of the summer going into the fall we had beautiful price action because the inter-market analysis agreed everything was moving in Harmony and when this happens you have very high probability price action all right now that we understand the basic premise behind in the market analysis how can we actually use this to our advantage well if we do an analysis ahead of the day ahead of the month ahead of the week I like to use intermarket analysis to get a basic view of the market because if I'm expecting the bonds to move lower so when I go into the dollar I have something that I want to be looking for ideally I want to look for higher prices if the bonds are going lower and of course vice versa this already makes it a lot easier when everything is agreeing it makes it so much easier you won't get blindsided essentially so inside the mentorship like I already mentioned we have a filtering process says this filtering process also has sort of an order of proceeding now like I mentioned when the bonds for example right here are consolidating I like to head to the dollar instead so here we are on the dollar and then I like to take a look at higher Turf and look at what the dollar is doing when I can get to a clear draw on liquidity on the dollar then that already tells me a lot about what Forex pairs want to potentially do and what indices potentially want to do so for example here let me take you through my analysis right here this is currently a Friday this is today if this candle now closes what do we see we create a daily fair value Gap right there what could happen next week we could see a potential sting into that daily for Value Gap and then a continuation on Lower previous day high sweep Etc and then we could Target this liquidity pool right there so again not Financial advice this might not happen at all so do your own analysis and if your analysis is different from mine then stick to your own analysis so right here if I'm expecting lower prices on the dollar then if we take a look at other pairs like foreign currencies so let's head over to them here we have EU Euro US dollar Euro of course foreign currency so this already tells me a lot of what my drone quality will likely be on EU then we have this liquidity pool right there and we have also the same scenario as in the daily verify Gap so you can see how this is already in harmony now of course if we take a look at gu gu is in the exact same situation but there is a minor difference can you notice the difference between the smt pair that we had established in the previous episode we had gu and EU if we are trading gu you would use EU as your smt pair and a fisa versa so in that case which one of those pairs which you buy and this is relative strength because if we take a look right here you can already tell probably this same high on EU has not yet been taken out and if we take a look at the move that happened from here to here this is a bigger and more explosive move than what happened on EU so this pair aka the currency Great British pound is stronger and relatively stronger than Euro so in that case you would want to buy Great British pound AKA gu so if we now repeat the steps of smt in the previous episode we came into some form of discount array because if we're now looking for high prices we are coming into some form of discount array then when we are waiting for confirmation we look for smt so whether the breaker or the swing failure happens in gu we already know that is irrelevant because we want to buy gu because on a higher timeframe basis and remember High atar famous where the orders are on a higher timeframe basis gu is stronger it is relatively stronger so that is the pair that we want to buy that is the currency that we want to buy now again if you are a complete beginner I always advise people to focus on one pair and focus on one pair only and master that pair and then eventually when you feel like you are limiting yourself then you can apply the filtering process that we use in a mentorship and then you can take it a more advanced route if you are not comfortable with that yet then I would always advise stick to one pair stick to one instrument whether that's es or EU or gu or even USD JPY stick to that pair and master that one first that will also test your patience Etc so then like we mentioned in the previous episode on smt as well then you don't have to worry about which pair am I buying which instrument am I buying etc etc so if we flip it around right if we take a look and maybe we expected the dollar to go higher then the whole situation would change because right here gu is relatively stronger but if we then take a look at EU again we can see EU was weaker so if we were looking for cells we would want to sell Euro so then it flips around right it's just vice versa if we were looking for cells we would want to sell Euro US dollar instead of GBP US dollar now how does this apply to the indices right here I'm on the continuous contract of es we can see es has been pretty strong if we take a look at NASDAQ you could tell between the smt pairs between es NASDAQ NASDAQ has been even stronger than es so if you were looking for pies then you would look at NASDAQ why it is relatively stronger it has more potential to go higher now of course there's one more smt pair between the indices and that is ym AKA The Dao now we can already tell right here the Taoist apps salute the weakest between the smt pairs on the indices so ideally I would not want to focus on bias on the Dow I would want to focus on ideally NASDAQ buys and then if es price delivery is a little bit cleaner then I would move to es buys but I would want to avoid the Dow buys of course that changes if you are focused on the Dow as your primary instrument to trade because you are not ready for that filtering process just yet then don't worry you can also just buy the Dow but again if we expected the dollar to go higher then the whole story would change we would look for lower prices on the Dow and then the Dao is the weakest it is relatively weaker than NASDAQ and then yes so I would prefer cells and shorts on the Dow instead of es and NASDAQ so when you go over this and price action also agrees so you have lean price action you have that clean marked structure that we talked about you have to clean plot the clean a lot you have fair value gaps to work with then you have an extremely powerful filtering process at your disposal so what I would love for you to do is if you go over this filtering process and you compare a few instruments a few Pairs and see which one is stronger see which one is weaker and compared with the dollar as well it's a dollar going highest dollar going lower again this can be all data this can be all in hindsight whatever you feel like and see where you had the opportunities to get in potentially using smt on the lower time frame and then see which one had the most explore closed captioning not available [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]</p>

## <p>all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video and we are going to be touching on Market structure and we are going to be touching on it even more in depth even more advanced we are truly going to take this to a Next Level so in this video I want you to truly take note of everything that I do because this is going to be a huge game changer and the insights I will give you are truly game changing in my opinion of course if I do say so myself but the thing is you need to pay attention that is very importantas well just a quick little announcement the masterclass enrollments are currently closed but there is a waiting list currently going on so what that means is once that waiting list is full I will not enroll any new people anymore and after this month so at the end of June the enrollments will open but in July in August and Romans will not open anymore and we are going to be focusing on the group that we have right there so if you want to be a part of that you want to be a part of those amazing Traders with even more insightswith way more details and a step-by-step guide to becoming a profitable Trader and allowing me to help you in putting everything together to get to that profitable stage then I would highly advise to check the first link in the description and join the waiting list alright without further Ado let's get right into it so in the top right what do we see we see sth and STL short term high and short term low then beneath that we have ith and itl intermediate term high and intermediate term on low so you need to understand both of theseconcepts are Market structure they they combine to make up Market structure and both of these are swing highs so when we truly outline it we get to this point right we have Market structure that leads to intermediate term high and short-term high and that leads to swing highs and then we talked about it the other way around so we went from doing highs to now intermediate the high short-term highs and then marked structure so if we dive into it right here but when we combine these swing highs and swing lows what do we get well if wetake a look right here what do we have here we have dead swing low and if we take a look at the left of that of this swing low what do we have we have another swing low right here and notice how this swing low is a little bit higher than this one and what do we have to the right of the middle swing low right here another swing low and this is a little bit higher than the one that we just talked about the middle one so this middle one has a swing low higher to the left of it and a swing low higher to the right of it that creates the middleswing low is an intermediate term low so only this swing low is now an intermediate term low the low to the left is a short-term low and the low to the right is a short term low as well so whenever there is a swing low that has another a higher swing low to the left of it and another higher swing low to the right of it then the middle low is an intermediate term low so if we inverse that and take a look at short-term highs and intermediate term highs we can already spot one I believe right if we take a look at this the mostclear one right here what do we have this is a swing high right then to the left of that what do we have as well another swing high that is a lower to the left of it and then what do we have on the right side for simplicity's sake let's just take this one right now we have another swing High AKA another short-term High lower to the left of that middle swing high this is now this middle swing high is an intermediate term high this is a short term high and this is also a short term high if you paid attentionright here you can probably already tell that currently we are on the daily time frame so if we zoom in a little bit in this price section what would we see we have a swing High here we have another swing High here and then we have another swing High here what is this high intermediate term high on the lower time frame so refractal thing so understand that this is an intermediate term High Why understand that it has a swing High lower to the left width and a swing High lower to the right of it now let's diveinto it even deeper after sweeping this intermediate term High what do we see we see a huge rejection then what do we actually get right here we see a fair value Gap right there and we have a previous day a high inside that fair value Gap right there then if we drop down into the one hour first and we are aiming for that alone that is our first drone liquidity so if we take another look at the daily we had that daily February Gap with that previous day I sweep what is the first discount array a liquidity pool what is actually a liquidity poolliquidity pool exists of what swing highs and swing lows so the first discount Raider We Touch is what That Swing Low right there there is your first discount array aka the first area where price is in discount short term discount so right here we are coming off of a premium rate and targeting a discount array note that down please that is very important to understand to frame the ID of Market structure premium to discount rate then what do we see if we zoom in again on the one hour and right here we have what right herewe have that short term High which is what that was the previous day hide that we are sweeping then the next thing we see is we have a sweep above that high into the daily fair value Gap now ask yourself what do we see here we see intermediate term High short term High short term High this intermediate term High is holding until when until we reach that first draw on liquidity and what do we see as well short-term High short term High short term High they are holding until when until we take an opposing intermediate term lowwhenever we take an intermediate term low which was this first discount array that is on the one hour our intermediate term low whenever we take an intermediate term high or an intermediate term low we can expect most of the time a bigger retracement so what will price do in between moving from note this down in between moving from intermediate term High to now an intermediate term low which is your drawn liquidity in between that short-term Highs are protected let me repeat that for you so you can write it down properly when we move from apremium array to a discount array and we are aiming our draw liquidity is this intermediate term low then we create an intermediate term high at the premium array that we established that premium array will push price lower will create an intermediate term High all the short-term highs that are in between that intermediate term high and intermediate term low will be protected until we reach that intermediate term low after we reach that intermediate term low the high that will be protected is now the intermediate term Highthat's a whole sentence again maybe repeat that a couple of times and compare it with what I just showed you in price action and that will be absolutely a big game changer so what I just said let me actually break it down right here in the chart so what do we see right here we are coming into the premium Ray what is our first Target a discount array what is that discount rate as well it is an intermediate term low on what on the one hour right here an intermediate term low when we come into that premium array on The Dailyright here it could be any time frame by the way yet this is all fractal but when we come into that premium array right here on the daily we are expecting an intermediate term High to be created now right here we push lower then what do we have next we have another short-term High created right here these highs this one this one should hold until when until we reach the opposing discount array AKA when we reach the intermediate term low so these short term highs this one this one this one should hold until wereach the intermediate term low once we take that intermediate term low we can expect a bigger retracement and now the high that is protected are not the short-term highs anymore the intermediate term height that was formed at the premium array that is the one that is protected right now so a bigger retracement would absolutely not be mind-blowing that is completely logical and is still a healthy pullback a healthy retracement again there is a lot of information to take into right now but we are going to go even deeper sowrite it down take notes watch it a couple of times you're going to need it alright so now let's dive into price a little deeper so what do we see you actually I think you probably noticed it right what do we actually see we are sweeping a high right here and then right here we create a high and we have some sort of intermediate term low right here but as I also like to call it the intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows are absolute Outsiders they are on the outside of your chart so if we take a look right here these are onthe absolute outside of our chart these intermediate are high and intermediate term low this is one that's still in the middle of a range so if we now zoom in on this price I can taking in into account that high that high that high and that high let's zoom into the 15 minute right here what do we see now we have something more to work with but if we take a closer look what did I just tell you I told you that short-term highs will hold until we take out an intermediate term low once we have taken that intermediate turn low we can expect abigger retracement a bigger pullback and now the next high that we'll likely hold is what an intermediate term High so when you take a look at Price action right here and now we are a bit more zoomed in so these highs on the 15 minute time frame are not short-term highs anymore they are what they are now intermediate termized so intermediate term High intermediate term high and in between intermediate term high I would call it then we have another intermediate term High intermediate term High intermediate term high and can you seeon a 15 minute time frame are drawn liquidity AKA or intermediate term low is already closer so we had this one then we had this one then we even had this one a very small intermediate term low and can you now see when the bigger pullbacks are happening aha there's something there there is something there so can you now understand what the next step is the next step is before we take out these intermediate terminals on the 15 minute if we zoom in on the one minutes what would actually happen well let's note these lows right herejust so we have a bit of a clearer view where the pullbacks are happening and what you will notice when we move from this height to that low in between that price action that is where you will have the highest probabilities of short-term highs on the one minute holding of course remember this is all fractal all fractal stuff but we are now going to look at on the one minute time frame is essentially the exact same thing that we just looked at on the one hour time frame so let's dive into the one minute time frame on this lag rightthere alright so this is the exact same price action that we just had on the 15 minutes now what do we notice I think you get it by now right I think you have a great understanding so this is the previous day hi that was swept and that is where we are coming into that daily fair value Gap as well so if we move this one a little bit higher what do we actually see intermediate term High right here where is your first intermediate term low right there what do we get after we take out that intermediate terminal we get some sortof bigger pullback right there now in between that price action when we take out that when we have that intermediate term High and then we have that intermediate term low in between so that is this price lag down that is where your short-term lows will hold afterwards when we take out that intermediate term low we can expect a bigger retracement now what did we talk about on the previous episode a retracement into what probably some sort of Premium Ray on what a higher time frame than the one minute sump kind of Premium rate that is on thehigher time frame not on the higher higher time frame that is on the time frame above the current time frame you are looking at so we are looking at the 1M every time frame above it there will likely be some sort of Premium array and price will reach into that exact premium array so if we take a look at the five minute what do we reach into a five minute fair value Gap AKA a five minute premium array five minutes is above the one minute yes now let's take a look again at the one minute ride here what do we see until we deliver to thatdrone liquidity that intermediate term low right there intermediate term High new your new intermediate term high right now so if we take out that low debt intermediate term high should now hold because this intermediate term High happened after that taking that intermediate term low so this was your retracement into that five minutes per value Gap then we continue lower this intermediate term high should now hold until we reach that intermediate term low after we take that intermediate term low what intermediateterm high should now hold this right here so if you've taken notes you can see there is a step-by-step process behind this stuff we have an intermediate term High in creation right there then we have an intermediate term lowest Target in between short-term highs should hold after we take that intermediate term low we can expect some sort of bigger retracement into what into a premium rate that is above the one minute time frame so that we are currently blind too but if we zoom out on the five minute time frame there willlikely be a premium rate again fractal if this was a 15 minute price action lag then we would likely reach for something under one hour then we would likely reach into a premium rate on the one hour or maybe even a four hour and which high in their process should now hold when we've taken out that intermediate term low that intermediate term High oh man this episode is oh man maybe I'm giving away too much I'm not sure if I'm able to share this FBI please FBI just called me they're like Ariel come on manwhat are you doing no I'm just joking but this is great information and and again it is up to you if you want to use it right it's up to you but in my opinion I would know what I'm doing so right here intermediate term hype which is priced lower than right here we have an intermediate term low as well right there somewhat of a big retracement into that fair value Gap don't need to hire time frame for this one right here and as well sometimes it will be very clear like here on the one minute you don'tneed to zoom out right here you could just use the one minute right here but for this right here we only have swing highs we don't have a clear Target right here then this is where I would zoom out and get a clearer view of price action so then we deliver lower now what do we see we have this intermediate term high after taking out that one then what happens next we retrace we have a big retracement what do we have retracement to remember what I told you our value Gap but not only for Value Gap what is itoverlapping with mitigation block right there that is what you would want to see two premium arrays at the same exact spot then we continue somewhat lower right here we have short-term highs holding and then we fill a little bit then this intermediate return low is currently still rejecting a little bit higher right there and again right there is completely normal we need to know that we are working with probability so these things are not 100 they may be 90 no 90 is still insanely good but just know that one of those 10 days there will bea shitty day and that's just that just is what it is if you understand the A to Z guide and you work on yourself and you follow the steps are outlined you will get as close as the Holy Grail as you can get and that Holy Grail that is you you are the Holy Grail exactly you the beautiful person that is currently listening to this you are that Holy Grail and I'm here too show you that and I'm here to let that Holy Grail show to the whole world I want you to shine as bright as possible so if we continuehere right here we have intermediate term high again then we could be aiming for that intermediate term low right so in between here what do we see again we have these short-term highs holding until we reach that intermediate term low but until we reach and that's why I put the line the intermediate term low we had established on the 15 minute time frame what is next we know that this intermediate term high should now be holding right this intermediate some high should ideally not get violated at all so why this intermediate term highand why not this one remember we are still in this bigger fractal picture so this is still a short-term high on what was it the one hour and an intermediate term high on the 15 minute and this intermediate term high was the retracement after taking that intermediate term low so this one should not get violated right now then we see the exact same thing happening over and over and over and over and over and over and over now this was a very Advanced lecture and we are not done yet because if you've taken notes you will know thatmarket structure is not just one thing on its own and you have the world at your feet no I know how to frame my mark structure and I know how I made it look so beautiful because context of the PD erase that we touched on in the first eight episodes that is what makes it so beautiful combining every single piece the flood the lot the swing Heist the fair value gaps the order blocks everything and especially the flood and the lot so the first line of defense and last line of defense combining that with your structure having a clear drone liquiditywhich I just touched on I just at the beginning if you didn't take notes you didn't catch it I just touched on the Drone liquidity again everything in harmony oh you are going to have an amazing time in the markets so study this this is a pretty long and intense lecture so you might want to watch this a couple of times and me just telling this to you won't make it click yes you might hear a little click but the big click will happen when you study this yourself so if follow the steps I outlined and and go give it a study whenyou do have the free time and that will absolutely give that big click for you and that is when you you are the holy girl and that is when you the Holy Grail will shine eventually so again reminder for the man to ship the master class is currently closed

all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video and we are going to be touching on Market structure and we are going to be touching on it even more in depth even more advanced we are truly going to take this to a Next Level so in this video I want you to truly take note of everything that I do because this is going to be a huge game changer and the insights I will give you are truly game changing in my opinion of course if I do say so myself but the thing is you need to pay attention that is very importantas well just a quick little announcement the masterclass enrollments are currently closed but there is a waiting list currently going on so what that means is once that waiting list is full I will not enroll any new people anymore and after this month so at the end of June the enrollments will open but in July in August and Romans will not open anymore and we are going to be focusing on the group that we have right there so if you want to be a part of that you want to be a part of those amazing Traders with even more insightswith way more details and a step-by-step guide to becoming a profitable Trader and allowing me to help you in putting everything together to get to that profitable stage then I would highly advise to check the first link in the description and join the waiting list alright without further Ado let's get right into it so in the top right what do we see we see sth and STL short term high and short term low then beneath that we have ith and itl intermediate term high and intermediate term on low so you need to understand both of theseconcepts are Market structure they they combine to make up Market structure and both of these are swing highs so when we truly outline it we get to this point right we have Market structure that leads to intermediate term high and short-term high and that leads to swing highs and then we talked about it the other way around so we went from doing highs to now intermediate the high short-term highs and then marked structure so if we dive into it right here but when we combine these swing highs and swing lows what do we get well if wetake a look right here what do we have here we have dead swing low and if we take a look at the left of that of this swing low what do we have we have another swing low right here and notice how this swing low is a little bit higher than this one and what do we have to the right of the middle swing low right here another swing low and this is a little bit higher than the one that we just talked about the middle one so this middle one has a swing low higher to the left of it and a swing low higher to the right of it that creates the middleswing low is an intermediate term low so only this swing low is now an intermediate term low the low to the left is a short-term low and the low to the right is a short term low as well so whenever there is a swing low that has another a higher swing low to the left of it and another higher swing low to the right of it then the middle low is an intermediate term low so if we inverse that and take a look at short-term highs and intermediate term highs we can already spot one I believe right if we take a look at this the mostclear one right here what do we have this is a swing high right then to the left of that what do we have as well another swing high that is a lower to the left of it and then what do we have on the right side for simplicity's sake let's just take this one right now we have another swing High AKA another short-term High lower to the left of that middle swing high this is now this middle swing high is an intermediate term high this is a short term high and this is also a short term high if you paid attentionright here you can probably already tell that currently we are on the daily time frame so if we zoom in a little bit in this price section what would we see we have a swing High here we have another swing High here and then we have

what is actually a liquidity poolliquidity pool exists of what swing highs and swing lows so the first discount Raider We Touch is what That Swing Low right there there is your first discount array
