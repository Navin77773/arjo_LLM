everyone can justify a trade ID but very little people actually know when to trade and on which days and weeks to get involved the people that know when to trade are the real professionals if you know when to trade you are ahead of 99 of your competition in order for us to be professionals there needs to be a boundary before we look at the chart just like there needs to be a boundary before we go into the lower time frame otherwise we can justify a trade ID every single day so to create a boundary we are going to go over low probability conditions and then also high probability conditions low probability conditions again when I talk about probabilities you need to remember I am truly talking about probabilities not a binary thing what I mean by that is a binary is it's on or off low probability there's a 20 chance on that day that you will win so there's still a chance that you will win but are the odds in your favor no high probability conditions are very easily summed up high probability conditions are clear one-sidedness now let's try to Define this if we are looking at gu right here and we are coming above that high right there clear one-sidedness is when you can only make arguments on one side of the market and you can watch the free weekly forecast because we exactly caught this move right there at that moment in time there are only bullish arguments to be made right there there is nothing from a probability standpoint there are no bearish arguments to be made right there from a probability standpoint there's no bearish fair value Gap lower there's not even a sweep of that high there's not an or block lower there's nothing bearish about that price action there are only bullish arguments to be made that is exactly when you want to be looking at the market or at any Market you are trading when there's clear one-sidedness so again clear one-sidedness is when you can make only arguments of one side of the market now is that going to be all the time no it's not and that's exactly why we have high probability conditions and low probability conditions in the first place it's not always going to be a high probability condition otherwise it wouldn't even be in high probability condition but in those high probability conditions you might have a win rate of maybe 80 90 with crazy returns because if you know where the weekly like this will expand then imagine how much profits you can make on the lower time frame by just knowing where the weekly will likely head towards a high probability condition like this based on price action alone will absolutely scream at you you don't have to force it when I went into the chart at this moment in time it only took two seconds for me to realize that is high probability condition and this is a general rule of thumb that I use in every major decision I need to take in Life or any small decision any decision you can think of if you need to convince yourself to do something then don't do it now how does that relate to trading if you need to convince yourself of certain price action then don't trade it because most likely you are forcing it and most likely that is not what you want to be trading if your intuition is taking over Etc then that setup will be so stupidly obvious whenever you get to whenever you're trying to get to a drama quickly the Drone liquidity should be so stupidly obvious like this especially after this candle after that down candle what will the next candle likely do it will move higher there's no bearish arguments right there to be made it's so stupidly obvious that this was the first draw liquidity so stupidly obvious so when you demand this off of price and price delivers exactly to your demands that is already high probability conditions so the highest probability condition is demanding something off of price and price doing exactly what you demonet off of it because then you already have set out in your mind certain guidelines that price needs to follow and you need to follow when price does deliver on that so you already have made up in your mind if price does this I do this so you have an if then there's no emotions in involved or whatever that is exactly what you want to have and that's the same premise when you open a chart and within the first five seconds you can already tell I like this that is exactly when you want to trade it because at that moment in time there are no emotions involved when you're trying to force it you're trying to force in low probability conditions there are emotion involved there's ego involved that is detrimental so I always tell my mentorship I can tell in 10 seconds whether I want to trade a certain instrument or not if there's nothing clear to me within that first 10 seconds then I don't like it again that's a general rule thumb for me 10 seconds is of course a bit of an exaggeration but one minute maximum if I can't get to clear draw liquidity within one minute then I don't trade it that's as simple as it is I don't force anything a similar scenario right here on USD Canadian dollar when we came into that Weekly fair value Gap right there overlapping with the mitigation block right there and we already had a huge rejection down then this next candle is so stupidly obvious that it wants to trade towards that swing low right there that is exactly the type of conditions that you want to have so low probability conditions are exactly the opposite of of course high probability conditions if you can't get to a clear drone liquidity there's no clear one-sidedness then you might have a 50 50 bias let's define a 50 50 bias a 50 50 bias is when you have both bullish arguments and bearish arguments whether you have 90 bullish arguments and 10 percent bearish arguments that is still low probability conditions high probability conditions is when you can only make arguments to one side of the market you want to have a hundred percent bullish arguments and a zero percent bearish arguments to take Longs for example right here on the dollar we had this as a drone liquidity and when we took out that drone liquidity we had an immediate rejection right there higher and based on the fair value gaps telling me a story video we know that this forward a block with that for Vega should ideally immediately push price lower and we shouldn't sweep that if we want to continue lower of course then afterwards what do we see we don't see a rejection lower we slowly climb lower we slowly climb higher so let's look at the arguments overall we have been bearish but we are sweeping that low we are not following through to the downside but overall we are bearish so right there we have around 70 bearish arguments and 30 bullish arguments that's a 50 50 bias that's not a high probability condition and you can see this PD array premium arrays right there not following through not showing fair value gaps lower and taking out that new low that leads to your Seek and Destroy conditions which is something we will go over more in depth in the next video as well when we look at this price action what tip we have we had an expansion right there going into a consolidation right there here the consolidation is a few candles this consolidation expansion consolidation concept also applies to only your singular candles so there's three candles consolidation expansion consolidation that consolidation creates your first candle of a potential fair value Gap that expansion creates the second candle of the potential fair value Gap the third candle will confirm the fair value Gap what do I mean by this when we look at this price action right here we have one two three that is the main premise behind it again that first consolidation can also be an expansion but it's being aware that this last candle right there that third candle that is the dangerous one because that one is unpredictable now the last general rule of thumb you need to use to identify low probability conditions is when we have had a major expansion to either side and we have taken a drama quality exactly what we're seeing here we have had expansion expansion expansion we have taken the draw liquidity that is exactly a low probability condition same for the most recent week when I'm recording this video actually we have taken that wrong Equity to the left in form of that low right there this right here was also low probability condition for me taking shorts right there was also low probability condition for me right there I would prefer taking Longs because we had a huge expansion and we had taken the drama quickly but again that is where you need to be careful that you are not trying to call a bottom so you wait for Clear bullish price action based on the higher time frame 4 hour and above when you're trying to chase price after a big expansion or trying to call about bottom or top that is exactly low probability conditions a few other low probability conditions for me are on the day itself trading ahead of CPI fomc and NFP because for me it usually consolidates ahead of that time ahead of that major news release of course we talked about the news events the other news events are perfectly fine they are tradable to me it's only CPI NFP and fomc if I want to trade on that day I want to trade after the news release trading ahead of those news events CPI NFP and fomc is low probability for my trading model it might not be low probability conditions for your trading model and that is where data comes in you collect data and over a hundred trade sample size you look at the trades and think all right from these 100 trades I can now gather great information on my low probability and higher probability conditions if I see my win rate is significantly lower trading ahead of CPI trading ahead of NFP or FMC then that exactly is your low probability condition but my data is not your data so that is where the difference comes in and that is where you need to do your own work because you have a unique individual trading model we went over high probability conditions and low probability conditions or trending models here this Seek and Destroy profile right there is someone's high probability because someone has a Seek and Destroy trading plan you either have a trending plan or seek any sort trading plan there's no in between and you only need one of them that is what I would advise focus on one of them so in the coming episodes we will exactly discuss how we can form a trading plan in Seek and Destroy conditions if you haven't watched the video on where we go in depth on news just yet I would highly advise to watch that video you can click on it right there alright perfect thank you [Music] thank you [Music]
