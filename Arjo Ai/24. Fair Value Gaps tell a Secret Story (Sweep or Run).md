our value gaps are telling you a story and it's up to you to understand the story so allow me to explain what the fair value gaps are trying to tell you when you do understand the story that the fair value gaps are trying to tell you you can get to a draw on liquidity way easier you will understand certain characteristics of price and in general it will make your trading much easier to understand in a previous episode we already touched on it briefly that episode is in perfect harmony with this episode so to define the things that I want to go over I want to go over a sweep versus a run a sweep of liquidity is when price takes liquidity and then moves to the opposite liquidity a run on liquidity for example a run on liquidity is when we have buy stops right here and price just keeps on going that is a run on liquidity a sweep on liquidity is where this happens if we have buy stops right there then we have a sweep like that that story and the differentiator what happened between a sweep and a run can be told by fair value gaps alone and also if you do remember the episode when we touch on overlapping PD race I told you there's a certain situation in price when that doesn't always happen and when I would prefer only a sting into a fry Gap instead of coming into that overlapping video so that is exactly what we're going to touch on now let's start off with a sweep whenever we are sweeping liquidity the fair value gaps that were being created pushing into that sweep they will get disrespected and we will form an st model that's as simple as it is so you can notice a certain characteristics of course the context behind everything is important although the perfect apps on its own already give you a lot of context that is exactly why I love to work with fair value gaps so right here we have a daily premium array that was selected on the weekly forecast as well then once we have a move into that can you see what is happening right there that bullish fair value Gap right there that was responsible for coming into that premium array can you see what is happening there now based on the previous episode we have a beautiful St right there but the story behind that SC is also that we are disrespecting a bullish fair value gap on the other side that is the main characteristic of sweeping instead of a run on liquidity whenever we sweep and we immediately rebalance a fair value Gap completely that is not what you would want to see if you are expecting a run on liquidity if you're expecting a sweep then that's perfect so when I do refer to a run on liquidity can you notice the difference between this price action and the price action we just saw whenever we went Above This high right there how can we know if we were sweeping that high or is it a run on liquidity a run on liquidity has a high probability of respecting a fair value Gap that is overlapping with the high or the low that it just swept and with respect I mean that it continues higher off of that fair value Gap overlapping with the high or low that it just swept and we sort of have a small staircase higher we stumble higher right there can you see that we are stumbling higher now what was the main premise again behind St the main premise was that an st as a volatility so there is likely huge orders behind that move because it's leaving behind inefficiencies that can be set as well here if we are truly sweeping a high we are not staying above it for a very long time and if price is stumbling higher right there it's not moving higher fast it is slowly continuing higher and we are respecting that first fair value Gap there overlapping with that high then this retracement can already be seen as just a retracement and not a sweep so to define the characteristics of a sweep versus a run a sweep is when we have the St model so we disrespect we would have disrespected that bullish for fire gap immediately after coming above that high I would have seen an st model to the downside and a run on liquidity is when we respect that fair value Gap with the overlapping high and we immediately reject higher off of that then we can already know when this retracement happens that is where we can look to write the expansion higher again so we know prices are still bullish whereas if we go back towards that sweep once this happens we know that price is targeting opposing liquidity what is opposing liquidity opposing liquidity are these equal lows right there when we have a sweep so we have that St model formed price will Target opposing liquidity buy side liquidity to now sell side liquidity so if we take a look at this example on again EU after sweeping that low right there can you see what happens the fair value gaps are telling you a story right there and the fair value gaps are trying to tell you that this indeed is a sweep and not a run on liquidity because if it was a run then somewhere these for vehicles or those for Value gaps would have been respect acted and we would have seen a continuation on Lower immediately and then afterwards we might have seen a bigger retracement but right here this is already your indication that we are now targeting opposing liquidity in the form of these highs and even higher and even that high and even that high constantly when we are running highs what is happening we have those highs that are getting taken afterwards what happens right there even those equal highs right there we respect the first fair value Gap right there and we continue higher off of that now of course the whole context behind that is also very important after this sweep right there of a previous week low into a weekly for Value Gap that is your weekly Target all the way up there and can you see how fractal this is can you see what we just talked about on a 15 minute time frame here on the four hour what are we seeing after sweeping that load that we just talked about 15 minutes that's 50 15 minute is an early indication now right here we have our St end right there we have an immediate retracement into that fair value Gap and we are slowly climbing higher right there and that right there is your SD entry after taking those highs we are coming into that fair value Gap and we are not coming into an overlapping PD array we are only coming into that fair value Gap and we are continuing higher then right here we are taking that high again if it's a run then we will respect that high and that fair value Gap that is overlapping with the high that we just took if we saw an st lower and we were disrespecting that high then we would have likely targeted opposing liquidity in the form of those equal lows right there so that leads me to the next point when we are expecting retracement I am not always expecting price to come all the way back into an overlapping PD array and let me tell you why whenever price is close to the draw liquidity so what do I mean with close to drone quality we already had our St model right there we are continuing higher and we are now relatively close to the Drone liquidity and that ultimate drone quality I would not expect price to retrace all the way back down towards an overlapping discount rate to continue higher and that is again based on the same story that the fair value gaps are telling you a story because if we were to continue higher right there then this fair value Gap would likely get respected based on the sweep versus The Run theory that we just talked about if we had an st going lower right there and we had a huge retracement rebalancing that full fair value Gap then I would argue well I think we might even be going lower instead of going higher so again how can we Define that when we are close to the drawn liquidity and we already had a huge expansion higher I would not expect price to make a big retracement lower into an overlapping PD rate to then continue higher I would only and I would only demand off of price to come into that first Ferrari Gap and then continue higher can you see the difference between this right there and the difference between this we had an SD going lower right there once we have this St going lower that already tells me that we are likely heading towards those lows right there so again the fair value gaps are telling me a story now in another episode I will touch on a more mechanical manner of how you can know that we only sting into one fair value Gap and are not coming into an overlapping period but in order for us to go over that mechanical manner I first need to go over a different aspect that is required for you to learn that mechanical manner if you understand how the fair value gaps are telling you a story then you need to try trading es because es is an absolute Beauty now again this works on every Market but yes is is so beautiful believe me after sweeping that low again how can we know it was a sweep what is forming right there what did we touch on in the previous episode an st can you see now why this was a perfect entry as well because they're formed in St right there and we were already disrespecting that fair value Gap and not continuing lower off of that fair value with the overlapping load that we just traded below now this is actually a part that I mentioned in the Discord in the mentorship when we went Above This high right there and we respected that fair value Gap so we traded into that fair value Gap and respect that high as well because we were immediately continuing higher off of this provide Gap overlapping with the height that we just went above then this move right there this move already told me that we are now heading towards the next draw liquidity which was those eyes right there again can you see the difference sweep run run respect verified overlapping with the high sweep disrespect verify Gap overlapping with the low and St model forms and if you follow along with es what happens right there we come above this high that drawn liquidity and what happens afterwards we create some kind of First St but what happens again that fair value Gap with what overlapping that high the same process over and over and over now why didn't we respect this fair value Gap right there and this is where the part comes in that we just talked about when I expect a sting we haven't taken the draw liquidity just yet and we are close to the drama query just like you saw here close to the Drone liquidity only a sting and we move higher right there we have taken the Drone liquidity so again you can define it we've taken the Drone liquidity so overlapping PD Ray one of the first overlapping PD Ray got verified Gap with that high which is a mitigation block with that fair value Gap that is exactly what you want to look for that is how you can build on the ID of the fair value gaps are telling you a story but they are whispering and you need to listen very closely to what they're telling you and with those guidelines for example a sting we have momentum drawn liquidity hasn't been taken yet we are close to it though alright we only expect a sting I wouldn't want a big retracement after taking the draw liquidity are we sweeping or are we running that liquidity that is exactly being told by the fair value gaps as well that are overlapping with that PD array and the beauty array is that high or that low that we just went above or below and the same thing happens over and over and over now please don't just listen to me and binge watch these videos please do some studying on your end and you will be absolutely mind blown on the material that we are teaching here because you know what they say once you see it you can't unsee it Define it well with it I would define all the concepts that I'm teaching here and you can see how this is in perfect harmony with your St model if you found this interesting I would highly suggest you to go to oreo.io sign up for the newsletter right there it's completely free every week I send out new emails with new information if you haven't watched the St model just yet or if you have watched it I would highly suggest you to watch it again and see how it is imperfect harmony with this video right alright thank you thank you [Music]
