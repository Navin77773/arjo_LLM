hello everyone hope you're doing all right and welcome to this first video well not actually the first but the first technical video on the A to Z guide so in the beginning this first video is on order blocks in the beginning you will have questions you will have doubts on certain topics etc etc this is completely normal write those questions done and they will likely get answered later on in the videos alright so I wanted to start with order blocks first off we are going over every PD array what is  premium and discount array premium obviously being if price is high it's in a premium and we are more likely to sell off and if we are in a discount for example here discount low prices we want to buy in discount we want to sell in premium so when I refer to a PD Array I refer to a premium and discount array if I'm looking for lower prices I'm looking to if I'm looking for lower prices I want to use a premium array and if I'm looking for higher prices I want to use a discount array alright so the first PD array I wanted to discuss is an orderblock now the theory behind order blocks obviously in the name order block there are orders inside that block whose orders are inside that block think of Institutions think of central banks institutions have such large orders they can't just simply press buy and sell wherever they want like weekend as retail institutions need to do the exact opposite of what price is currently doing to get into the mark so for example and by the way every up candle right here is white and every down candle is bluish black so institutions are buying Down Candles simply because their orders are so large they can't buy on up candles institutions Buy on Down Candles why for every buyer there needs to be a seller for every seller there needs to be a buyer if we know there are willing sellers right here who is buying those sell orders institutions what do we create when institutions are buying those sell orders order blocks alright so let's get into it how can we actually spot an order block again some things might be a little bit confusing because obviously it's the first video so go in with an open mind and don't expect to growth every single thing right now so we just explained the basics and the logic behind an order block of course if you have a different logic and that logic works for you please go ahead and use a logic my logic might not be for you and that's completely fine if you have a different logic and you want to use a different logic that's completely fine I'm not here to I'm not here to force a logic down your throat oranything My Philosophy Etc I said in the intro video everyone needs their own logic what makes sense to them everyone is a unique individual so everyone needs their own unique logic their own unique view on the market so again if my logic doesn't suit your logic stick to your own logic perfect be fine alright so if we know institutions are buying in Down Candles and selling in up candles then Up and Down Candles would be order blocks right correct so so let's go over a few criteria that an order block needsto have if we are looking for a bullish order block and note that down a bullish order block we want to see a down candle a down candle that fits the criteria area is a bullish order block a bullish order block needs to come off of support it needs to break the high of the down candle then that creates a bullish or block if it then returns to that order block we can possibly buy of course not Financial advice and then here you can see the fourth is empty empty stands for mean threshold mean threshold is 50 ofthe order block and it's only the bodies of the candle not the Wicks the bodies of the candle 50 of that is mean threshold so whenever I refer to mean threshold it's 50 of the bodies of a certain candle all right now let's look at some different order blocks for example these two Down Candles an order block doesn't have to be one single candle it can be but if there's multiple consecutive Down Candles or multiple consecutive up candle it is one big order block so these two consecutive Down Candlesare one order block is it coming off of a previous support yes we have a fair file you get right here now you might not know what a fair value Gap is currently so if you don't know write that down we'll get into it in a later video so these two Down Candles is one order block we are coming off of a previous support level this verify Gap if this is the if this is the order block what's the second thing we need we need the high to get broken what's the high of this or block since we can basically see this as a one big orderblock this is the high now the next thing we need is a return a return and a new push away this is the very basics of an order bug but the basics are important for you to master people like to skip the basics and this is why I said this A to Z guide is also for advanced Traders why Advanced Traders a lot of the times forget these simple steps and they are essentially ahead of themselves and they forgot to master the basics what makes someone a master is when they Master the simple Basics and they apply them on aconsistent basis master the basics and you will Master trading alright so we have one two three support level high gets broken we have a return perfect then the fourth one the empty the mean threshold the mean threshold would be this right here now this is a little bit Advanced now why is the mean threshold important and why did I even mention it if this order block does want to hold I wouldn't want to see the main threshold aka the 50 of this or block get disrespected disrespected meaning closing below the mean threshold now forthe open of the order block why did I take this Wick and not the body of the candle the wick is overlapping with a fair value Gap again you might not know what a favor Gap is right now so write that down so the top of the week only the top of the wick is important to me right here the top of the wick is overlapping or with a very very Gap right here and that's why I take the top of the wick if this wasn't overlapping with a verifying app then I would have taken the body of the candle why well if the wick wasn't overlapping with a fairvalue gap for example we can say let's pretend that this is the wick right here and it isn't overlapping with the flag at the top of the wick then the top of the wick is not the sensitive area the top of the wick is already mitigated so the unmitigated orders are right here in the body of the candle again remember what we've gone over a bullish order block is just Down Candles a bearish order block is just up candles but again the context behind them the steps etc those are important and that's why notevery down candle and not every up candle is an order block the context behind them is very important as well as are they aligned with your bias if you think price is going higher and if price is going higher then every up candle is not a bearish order block and if you think price is going lower so for example this up candle if price is in a bullish movement this is not a bearish order block now we've just gone over a bullish order block let's dive into some bearish border blocks as well so as you may haveseen right here try to spot all the bearish order blocks right here and what makes them a bearish order block alright so we are pushing lower after coming above this High AKA this week Above This high is a sweep of the high what is basically happening right here breakout Traders so people with a buy stop that are buying when the high gets broken right here will have a stop loss below this low so price will Target the opposite side now if we know this and we are sweeping this High then we have a bearish bias all the up candles that areforming when we have bearish buyers will act as an order block and these up candles will more than likely hold a lot of the times this right here is it coming off of a resistance again if we're looking at a bearish or block we want to see it come off of resistance and we're going to see the low get broken we're coming off of small fair value Gap right here we are rejecting away we are breaking the low and notice how mean threshold got respected right here no candle close above mean threshold then we have another up candle righthere this up candle is it coming off of resistance yes did it break the low off this up candle yes the low got broken right here did it return to the ore block yes it returned right here did you respect mean threshold yes it respected mean threshold very important for you to understand not every order block will hold not every order block where me threshold gets respected will hold not every order block where mean threshold gets disrespected will hold but we have to think in probabilities these are the highest probabilityconditions these are where the odds are in our favor and how do we select the bearish order box right here we take the bodies why no fair value Gap overlapping again if you don't know what a fair value Gap is write that question down and we'll get into it later now if we move on here we have this new order block right new up candle New Order block low gets broken a return to the order block the wick right here empty gets respected and we see a new rejection away now what do we create right here a newbearish order block is it as simple as this well yes it can be will it always be as simple as this no an order block will fill sometime now spotting a high probability order block and spotting a low probability order block if something we'll get into later for you it's important to now go over your own charts and seeing which order block holds and which order block fails by doing this you will train your own brain you will train your own eyes you will train your own intuition which is very importantbecause then you're developing your own Edge just by me telling you these steps will not help you you have to do the work on your own I'm just giving you the guidelines to get you to actually start the work now again this is an order block why it's coming off of previous resistance in the form of this order block the low got broken a return the return doesn't have to happen for it to be an Orbach only support and resistance and the high and low so the first two steps those two have to happen for it tobe considered an order block all right now let's take a look at some bullish order blocks as well alright perfect Can you spot the bullish order blocks right here so let's take a look together right here we have a bullish or block why we're coming off of some kind of support right here in the form of a rejection block write that down then the high is broken we see a return these are all consecutive Down Candles so this is one big order block mean threshold would be right here I mean threshold getsrespected what happens after we create a new or the block right here a new bullish order block why it's coming off of previous support in the form of this bullish order block then we create this new order block right here then we create a new order block right here and here we create a new order block this order block builds and we have a big rejection to the downside and then a continuation up now what does this create some form of New Order block right now what happened here this order block gets respected mean threshold getsdisrespected and we still continue higher we had this order block fail main threshold gets disrespected right here what is happening the market is wrong surely I'm doing something wrong right no not every order block will hold like I said not every time the main threshold will get disrespect and the order Buck will fail but we are working with probabilities and that's what a lot of people forget a lot of people forget that we aren't working with probabilities so after our loss after something doesn't work once or eventwice they will look for the next best thing something that will guarantee them 100 win rate and that's why a lot of people got into smart money Concepts and into ICT in the first place right A lot of people got into smart money Concepts into ICT why because they thought it was the answer to everything and in some way the market isn't random but if you are seeking for that just be very conscious of the fact that you might be searching for the Holy Grail because why a lot of people got into ICT and smart moneyConcepts in the first place is because they thought it was the Holy Grail and let me tell you it isn't and you will still take glasses and things will still fail alright let's continue right here I just want to touch on this last little order block right here this order block right here do we take the wick or the open of the order block there is a referral Gap right here but the top of the wick isn't overlapping with the forfeit so take the body study this price action that's coming up study this price actionon your own until Friday I want you to study and focus on order blocks so Wednesday and Thursday focus on order blocks order blocks order blocks order blocks which down candles are holding which up candles are holding why are they holding what's happening beforehand on which time frame are they dip me threshold get disrespected did it get respected what happened are we very high are we high in premium are we low in discount what is happening notice the patterns Etc use the journal that was provided in the intro videoand note all your discoveries if you truly master or blocked then I want to thank you and that's the end of the A to Z guide for you because order blocks alone could make you profitable on that note I'll see you in the next video on Friday and I want to thank you for being here alright thank you thank you
