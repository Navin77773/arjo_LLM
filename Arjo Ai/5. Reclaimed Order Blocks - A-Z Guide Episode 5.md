hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video on the A2Z guide today we are going to talk about reclaimed order blocks the name in itself already says a lot but we are going to dive a little bit deeper into it now as well this will touch on the very basics of a market maker model and an advanced Market maker model video will come later in the A to Z guide as well a little announcement might mentorship enrollments for the master class is opening up again this Saturday so that's the 20th of May and they willclose again at the end of next Monday so that is the 22nd of May so in that time period I open up the enrollments so if you are interested and you're a little bit more advanced in ICT so you've watched one series minimum and you feel overwhelmed with all the information then this might be for you link is in the description if you do want more information on it so do check that out if you are interested alright without further Ado let's dive straight into it so here in the top right you can see thefirst step is understanding that there's two curves so there's two curves of the marker right we have a cell curve right here and then once we reach a certain discount array we have a by curve right here and we're going higher and higher this is the basis of a market maker model so take notes if you don't know fully Watermark maker model is and again we'll touch on everything in this A to Z guide so this is two curves we have a cell curve and a by curve now this is a marker maker bi-model and then theopposite would be a buy Curve and then another cell curve this is a marker maker cell model now why is this important well these marker maker models happen everywhere the context behind them is very important again there will be a more advanced marker maker model video so don't worry but we need to understand that if we are looking for higher prices so we are expecting a market maker by model then right here when we are moving down institutions their orders are so huge that those institutions they can't just simply buy and sell likewe can like retail can now they have to get in the market earlier so if we have a market maker buy model and we are anticipating a market maker by model 2 form then on the sell side of the curve that is already where institutions are buying so what you'll see is you'll see order blocks start to form bullish order blocks remember a bullish order Block it's a down candle and the high of the down candle gets broken they get formed on the sell side of the market maker by model so right here Order blocks are forming becauseinstitutions are already buying they are hedging they are already in the market they are offering counterparty liquidity to all the sellers right there and then once we reach a discount array so that's very important for you to acknowledge that's very important for you to write down as well once we reach a higher time frame this country or some sort of discount array then you will likely see some sort of displacement with maybe a market structure shift and then we might see a shift in order flow and then all the order blocks thebullish order blocks that's formed on the sell side of the curve of the marker maker bimodel Curve will hold us support and then we push higher that's the basics of a market maker model so remember we have a cell side curve and a bisect curve cell curve by curve that's it and inside the cell curve there will already be order blocks and once we trade above them on the right side then they are called reclaimed order blocks so what does that look like on the marker maker cell model exact same thing just inverse right herewe have the buy Curve these are ready so right here inside here there could be a bearish or block that gets traded through first and then holds us a resistance right here because now it's a reclaimed or block once we are on the right side so we have the left side the by side of the curve on the market Mega cell model and then we have the right side the cell side of the curve on the marker maker cell model and these right here will be your reclaimed order blocks all right now we have discussed the two curves so the twocurves then we have order block or block what is an orb block again order block a bullish order block again a down candle where the high gets broken remember that step that we talked about in the first video you only need to know that step that the high gets broken on a bullish order block on the bearish order block the low gets broken right so that is a bearish or block again we've also talked about the steps for in that steps on the order blocks but that's not really important we just need to know a bullishorder block the high gets broken on a down candle and a bearish or block the low gets broken of an up candle and that's it that's what we need to know so then the third step is left so you always look to the left to spot your reclaimed or blocks because we have two curves and on the left side so that first curve whatever that is this that's where the reclaimed order blocks will be alright now let's dive into some real chart examples so right here we have the four hour order block remember an order block this is a four hour orderblock and then if we drop into the lower time frame and we drop into the 15 minute right here we have a buy side of the curve and a cell side of the curve the very basics of a markup maker cell model so two curves buy side sell side right here if we take a look at some order blocks some bearish order blocks that were formed on the by side of the Curve so for example we have one right here take the body of the order block right here and then if we zoom in a little bit we have another one right here then we have another big one right herethen we have another one right here can you see how many reclaimed order blocks there are in this little section right here see what price it did right here it had a very difficult time getting Above This level again once we move down below every reclaimed order block right here it was very tough for price to get above these reclaimed order box right here again so here you see consolidation and we touch again higher but we never come back above those reclaimed order blocks and if we take a little bit of a looklower right here what do we have a bearish order block and here right here we have another one now you might notice I'm not taking the consecutive up candles here I'm only taking the last up candle right here so that's a little difference in the ore block as well that's just for me because we're taking things from the left right here it's a little bit more Precision but that way your chart doesn't get clustered as well of course as you can see already I don't like how there's somany lines already here so what is a solution to that well you might notice the reclaimed order blocks that work well are the ones that are overlapping with something else I always emphasize on this fact PD arrays are great they are absolutely awesome but and especially reclaimed order blocks I only like to use them when they are overlapping with another PD array so instead of having a thousand lines on your chart right here what I would have is I would have this right here why let me explain we have this reclaimed or blocks and again reclaimedorder blocks are not that exciting right they are very easy to spot Etc when is it actually becoming a reclaimed order block when we are trading below it so when we are trading below it whether it's a wick or body once we are trading below it then it becomes a reclaimed order block so right here we are already trading below it we can see we have a move higher what is happening here we don't have any clear overlapping PD array we don't even have a fair value Gap as overlapping there and pay attention to what happened is next righthere what do we have here we have an order block we have a verifier Gap here we have mitigation block there is four things overlapping here come with me one reclaimed order block mitigation block order block fair value Gap four things overlapping that's what makes BD arrays so strong so always look where is a logical place we can return to that isn't all the way up here so all the way up here isn't really relevant but that's close to current price action that we can return to where the most overlapping PD rays are alright so if wetake a look at this other one right here we have an up candle we are trading below that up candle so we're breaking low this could be a bearish or block ride we disrespected fully we then have we are finishing the buy side of the curve cell side of the curve we are trading back below this old bearish or block this now becomes a reclaimed order block then right here what is overlapping with this reclaimed or block well there's a mitigation block again in close proximity to it there's an order blocksitting right here and you have a verify Gap here and here so a sting into this River Gap wouldn't have been crazy right we could have seen it coming because we have a lot of things overlapping for us and that overlapping part that's what I want you to understand for this reclaimed or block because otherwise like we just had in the beginning your charts will be clustered with reclaimed or black hair reclaimed auto block here reclaimed order block here right here right here and we have a thousand lines and that's not accuracyright we can tell you all right price will bounce off of one of these thousand lines yeah well no right and that's the same part as if we draw random lines right here complete random lines right look at this resistance resistance right here it's resisting it all right now it's acting a little bit of support all right resistance again and if we go even further to the left look at this perfect support Perfect Resistance right here Perfect Resistance perfect right just randomize resistance becoming support it's consolidating arounddeadline because its support and resistance look to the tick to the absolute tick right perfect accuracy if you have a thousand PD arrays on your chart then you are not accurate No you're just guessing and that's why I don't like to explain a thousand PD arrays because it's not accuracy anymore it's just random and what a lot of people like to do on Twitter and Instagram Etc or even on YouTube they say look at the accuracy well no you have a thousand PD arrays on your chart it will respect one of them what is theaccuracy there there is no accuracy so understanding those overlapping PD Rays that's so important because the PD arrays in itself are not that hard to spot right but knowing where it will likely bounce off of where it will reject that is pretty hard to spot the way we can spot that is by focusing on the most overlapping PD race and again we will dive into this deeper and deeper don't worry this is just the basics alright now let me give you a bullish example as well alright we didn't have to go very far this right here is oursell side of the curve right this is our buy side of the curve so we have again two curves then on the cell side of the curve where are the order blocks so the cell side of the curve focus on the bullish order blocks because we are anticipating a higher prices alright well if we take a look right here and dive a little bit deeper into price action we have this would be considered a bullish price action right again the body of the down candle right here the high gets broken the very basics of an order block andeven an order block right here and even an order block right here and even right here again we have a thousand lines on our chart and we can make the same argument again whoa look at the accuracy well they're not really accuracy because we have a thousand lines obviously it will bounce off of One how can we make this more accurate well this reclaimed order block and we could even say this is a reclaimed World block as well right because the high of this down candle gets broken with an up candle right herewe drop down below we are still on the sell side curve and then we initiate the bicep curve what happens right here we have an overlapping fair value Gap we even have some sort of breaker overlapping so that's three discount arrays reclaimed order Block Breaker fair value Gap where does it go higher off of is very very Gap overlapping with the other two discount race and that's exactly what I'm trying to tell you here and that's exactly what makes BD arrays so strong when they are overlapping withanother PD array and again this reclaimed order block as well right what do we have overlapping well we have this big order block right here coming off of this fair value Gap pushing higher new displacement fair value Gap this small order block there's a lot of stuff overlapping and that's what makes it interesting so what I want you to do I want you to study this reclaimed order block but I want you to study how many blocks so all the blocks we went over how many can you find that are overlapping so find find thesimilarities of reclaimed order blocks that are holding and find out why are they holding are they overlapping with a lot of other PD arrays because very often that's the case so study those two curves those order blocks on the left side once they get traded above or below they become reclaimed are they overlapping with something and that's where the highest probability reclaimed order blocks are and other PD Rays alright last reminder masterclass enrollments of my mentorship are currently open that have been greatresults of the most clots so far so if you have watched one ICT series at least and you have pretty good knowledge on ICT so far then that might be for you again very limited spots and very limited time only that weekend from the 20th of May until the 22nd of May for you to sign up and then enrollments will close again alright I'll see you at the next video on Friday thank you thank you [Music]
