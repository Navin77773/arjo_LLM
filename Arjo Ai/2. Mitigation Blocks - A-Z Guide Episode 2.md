all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to the second video we are going to talk about mitigation blocks so I hope everyone has done their homework I hope everyone has studied order blocks then the next thing for you to do after this video up until Tuesday 8 30 a.m when we talk about next topic study the mitigation block and the order block so study both things you might notice that you like one of them more than the other so you might like order blocks more you might like mitigation blocks more that'sperfectly fine you don't need to know everything in order to be profit find the thing you like and run away with it then as well this Sunday 8 30 am the 7th of May I'm going to be doing a live stream here on YouTube I'll have a reminder in my telegram link is in the description and we are going to be mainly going over mindset Etc because I feel like a lot of people have been struggling the past few weeks and that's exactly what I want to touch on alright now let's dive straight into it so for a mitigation block I havethese few structured steps right here the first one is pattern the second one is a low slash High the third one is overlapping now of course the steps won't make any sense if you don't watch the videos and that's the purpose of them so if we take a look at the first step the first step is pattern now the first thing I want you to acknowledge and this is very simple you don't need a lot of knowledge for you to understand this pattern the first pattern is basically we have a down move just a down movethen we have another up move this up move fails to take out this high this is a swing High swing High swing low will touch on it in a later topic this low this swing low fails to take out this swing high and then we see another rejection lower this is a swing failure again that's something we'll touch on in later videos as well so don't worry this pattern is called a swing failure pattern now what this swing filler pattern creates is a mitigation block so right here if we trade back into this lowthere is our mitigation block and then we continue lower now the third one is overlapping overlapping is indicating at this mitigation block there's another premium array in this case premium array because remember we're going lower we are looking at premium arrays there's another premium array overlapping with the mitigation block so that could be a fair value Gap here but that could also be what we learned in the first episode an order Block in this leg right before we take out the low there might be a little bearish orderblock right here overlapping with the mitigation block and that makes two premium Rays that's double as strong as one mitigation block alone so right here we have the pattern we have our swing failure pattern so write that down it's a swing failure pattern the next thing is the low in this case the low slash high if we turn this thing around we have the same exact thing we have the pattern right here we have the high and then we continue higher now you might say this is support and resistance well yes you're not wrong but the thing thatmakes it so strong is the logic behind find it and the thing why support and resistance sometimes works is because you'll see this exact pattern now the logic behind it is if if we are moving lower there will be buyers right here in this low and they will buy this leg up now once we move lower and we retrace back up to this low then the buyers the buyers in this leg have a chance to mitigate their buy orders AKA take a loss Etc or take a break even and then price is able to continue lower so for example let's say we are retailTraders and I don't mean retail as in the individual Trader I mean retails in the retail Concepts the support and resistance concept let's say we saw some nice support right here and we are buying this alright we're getting a rally perfect now we drop down immediately we're in drawdown now the next thing price retraces back to our entry we are able to mitigate that order and we can close it Earthly fine now there might be some traders that got in right here and then they take a little bit of a net lossperfect and that's what we need this liquidity for price to move now like I said in the previous episode we need for every buyer we need a seller for every seller we need a buyer now does that mean that Average Joe behind his monitor is getting taken out of the market because his five Lots is what the central banks and the institutions need no so if you ever see someone saying oh the market is hunting me well you're you're 100 Lots don't really matter we are talking about institutions that aretrading retail Concepts so the big big big boys not your neighbor that's putting 100 Lots on gold no that's not relevant and that's important to acknowledge because a lot of people think they are getting hunted by the market just because they placed an order this is not necessarily true now if you place an order on a b Book Broker open up the spreads they take you out and then it continues that's what happens a lot of the time on a b Book Broker so if you choose a broker I'm not here for youto use my affiliate link and go to my broker that's not what I'm doing here do your own research and make sure you're not trading on a b Book Broker not Financial advice as well first practice in demo and Brokers is something we can get into later on alright with this bit of the logic behind it Etc now of course make your own logic if this logic is not completely true perfectly fine if it works for you then it works for you and that's all that matters so if there's someone on Twitter that's telling you noyou don't have the right logic just tell them thank you for your opinion I'm going to do my own thing no need to get into an argument or anything we just focus on ourselves here all right now let's take a look at some live examples right here let me remove these things so the first one can you notice the first one right here it's the same exact pattern that we just had it's right here notice this down move the retracement up this low fails to take out this high then we have a swing failure the swingthis swing up pills to take out this High a swing failure we continue lower and then we have a slight retracement right here into what your mitigation block right here now let me remove the lines just to make it a bit more clearer and where do we take the mitigation block the low slash High we are bearish so we take the low of the mitigation block this can be the absolute low of the wick doesn't have to be the body so right here boom and again you can apply the same logic if you want to if that Wick isn'toverlapping with a fair value Gap then you take the body if the wick is overlapping with a further Gap then you take the wick that's up to you those minor differences that's a little personal preference just because you select the wick or the body is not going to make you a millionaire all of a sudden that's not what it's about and that's what a lot of people think right they they think oh is he is he selecting the body or is he selecting a wick just do what you prefer just because he selected the wick or the body that's notgoing to be a major Game Changer but again if you want to make it easy for yourself stick to the rule if the wick is overlapping with a profile Gap then take the wick if the wick isn't overlapping with a verify Gap then take the body alright but the last step right here is number three overlapping and again if you don't know what a fair value Gap is just yet perfectly fine because then later these videos will make even more sense when you re-watch them not if when you re-watch this video so the overlapping if you know what afavorite cup is what's overlapping with this mitigation block a fair value Gap and this is exactly what makes the mitigation block so strong and other PD arrays as well when there's something overlapping right here we have a fair value Gap and this is what makes it so so strong and this is as well for the advanced Traders when we notice this pattern price doesn't have to come all the way back up into here this is already fair value or price to continue lower and that's exactly when a mitigation block is sostrong and this is how I like to trade mitigation only when there's something overlapping preferably a fair value Gap alright so let's take a look at some more examples and some bullish examples as well so right here we have a bullish example and again if you do feel like it it's perfectly fine to pause the video and try to spot the mitigation block or any other block beforehand and before I touch on it this way you will learn faster alright so we have the pattern right here we have this big up moveright here we have this down move this I fails to take out this low and even this low continues higher which creates a mitigation block now it's very important for you to acknowledge and this is as well for you to write down it's a swing failure and write down as well it's not a breaker pattern now you might not know what a breaker pattern is just yet but it's a different sort of thing there's a swing failure and a breaker better write it down come back to it later on when we touch on Breaker blocks and then it willmake more sense so it's essential for us that we have this big move up first and then a high that fails to take out the low continue higher which creates the high a mitigation block now in this case if we do apply that rule let's then take the body instead again personal preference if you want to stick to that rule then perfectly fine stick to the rule the thing is on this High we take the up candle of the mitigation block so here we take the up candle just like we saw on the previous example when it's abearish mitigation block we take the down candle now what is overlapping see this right here there's an overlapping fair value Gap with that mitigation block and that's exactly what I like so much about mitigation block combined with a perfect Gap or as you'll see in another example combined with a border block as well alright so here we have another example now it gets interesting and again these things are not rocket science they are very simple structured easy steps trading is not a rocket science and it'snot supposed to be if we can keep it simple and there's a reason why we keep it simple and that's what I touch on a lot in the mentorship there's a specific reason why we keep things simple and why it's so so so important now if we take a look at this mitigation block right here we have the pattern the swing fill your pattern we have the high and we have something overlapping see what's overlapping it's an order block at the mitigation block and a verify Gap that's three discount arrays at the sameexact spot remember that because that's important the more overlapping PD arrays are at one spot the stronger the defense is so right here we take the up candle because it's a bullish mitigation block the mitigation Block in itself is overlapping with a fair value Gap and then just below that fair value Gap we have this order block as well remember what an order block is remember the steps of getting to an order block this is the exact steps and this is what makes a mitigation block so super strong all right now let's take a look at onemore example and then you're going to head into your own chart and do your own work as always remember if you don't do the work yourself then these videos will always just be some sort of entertainment for you watching videos without integrating the stuff and without working on it is just entertainment nothing more alright so right here we have another example and you can see how I'm using different time frames because this is a fractal thing every one of these topics is completely correct now the higher time frame thehigher the time frame we use the stronger the PD Ray so if we're looking at a weekly right now this will be stronger than a daily or a four hour video why the biggest orders are on the biggest time frames and if we know this effect then why not focus on the higher time frame and understanding the higher time frame because that's where the real orders are of Institutions etc etc so again the same exact pattern swing fill your pattern this High fills to take out this low we move higher after this high and this is what you'll see a lot rightafter we take the high and we close above it we have a fair value Gap right here overlapping with the high or an order block like we just saw and we move back into the mitigation block with the overlapping discount array we move higher now remember what I said this happens a lot when we close Above This High close not wicking the high and then we have a short-term return and then we push even higher so a lot of people say we have this mitigation block right here we have the swing filler pattern right here and now we're coming back all theway down would you still use the mitigation block no I personally wouldn't I would look at something on the higher time frame but from what I can see this mitigation block has already been used we've already traded back into it short term here this was our opportunity right now we just wait for new price action so we take the low slash the high in this case we take the high obviously overlapping or width of your value Gap and we push higher again swing for the pattern we close above it and that's a little golden nervous foryou if you made it to the end we close above it then we have a short term return another little Golden Nugget for you you're getting rewards for if you stay to the end of these videos and then we rarely hire close short-term return rally higher then we have the swing filler pattern the high in this case because it's a bullish mitigation block and it's overlapping with a verify gap or like we just saw on the previous example overlapping with an order block or another Discounter alright now for you I want you to study this on your ownI want you to make up your own logic of it I want to see if you can make up your own pattern of it so if you recognize a few things that happen over and over and over and over when these mitigation blocks hold but also look at a few mitigation blocks see if you can spot them that failed is obviously not every mitigation block will hold even if they are as clean as this one and that's the reality of trading all right I want to thank you quick reminder live stream on YouTube right here this Sunday 8 30 a.mNew York eastern time and we are going to talk about the mindset the Trader's mindset the champion mindset and the next video on the A to Z guide is obviously Tuesday 8 30 am New York eastern time as well alright thank you and make sure to do the work thank you thank you foreign
