I am going to be telling you all the secrets to Market structure in this episode I will go over things about Mark circuit that I have not touched on before on my YouTube in a previous episode inside the A2Z guide we also went over marked structure so I think the basis the bird's eye view of Market structure the way I view it is pretty clear but now I want to Define it even more because again if you understand this this is literally all you need first I wanted to go over NASDAQ and afterwards we are going to go over a Forex pair as well please please on this episode it is crucial to listen to everything I say and to take notes now let's start off with how do we View Market structure again so let's remind ourselves of the basics again we only look at intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows and short-term highs and short-term lows the way I view an intermediate term high and this is the only way I view it nothing else I don't look at is rebalancing a fair value Gap is doing this no the only way I view an intermediate term high is when we have a high that is in the middle and is in between a short-term height that is lower to the left of it and lower to the right of it so this for example right there is an intermediate term High the same for intermediate term low an intermediate term low is when we have a load that is in the middle it is in the middle of a short-term load that is higher to the right of it and a short-term load that is higher to the left of it so this right there is an intermediate term low and they are The Outsiders intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows are always Outsiders what I mean by that is that this for example right there this is also a short-term low this is a short-term low which makes this as well an intermediate term low but if this intermediate term low has an intermediate term low just below it very close to it like this one then you would take this one not this one it's the same with the intermediate term High when this if we look at it from an objective standpoint yes this could be an intermediate term high but this is your real intermediate term high and if we want to look at it from an objective standpoint that is exactly what we're going to go over because if we combine the time frames then this is not an intermediate term high but that is something we will go over in a few moments first we need to talk about the short-term highs and short-term lows now so this is an intermediate term high this is an intermediate term low listen very carefully in between moving from this intermediate term ahai to that intermediate term low short term highs will form no intermediate term high will form in that period so when we move from that intermediate term High to that intermediate term low in between this price action there is no intermediate term High every High that's there is a short term high and if short-term high is defined by having of course a swing high so that right there let me zoom in a little bit that right there is a short-term high this right there is a short-term high now this could that be an intermediate term high no it is not why isn't it an intermediate term High an intermediate term Hive forms after we take an intermediate term low so once we take this intermediate term low right there which is the target when moving from the intermediate term High to the intermediate term low if we then get a bigger retracement this intermediate term high is the one that is protected and now we can expect potentially if it does want to have a bigger retracement then it will likely respect that high with respect it means that yes it can take the high but it's respecting the high still this is your last line of defense if we disrespect that so aka the fair value Gap video that we went over if we close above it if the bullish firefighter gaps are getting respected right there then that is a sign that we are disrespecting that high that is not supposed to happen so once we do take that intermediate term low and we have a big retracement we know all right it shouldn't take that high right there but that high in the middle is not an intermediate term high so the thing I'm trying to tell you here is that only once we take the intermediate term low right there only then a new intermediate term height can form once we have a bigger retracement so again in between from moving from that intermediate to my to that intermediate terminal short-term highs will form now a short-term high is not just a swing High let me first go over one thing when we have an intermediate term I for example this one to now your intermediate term load your new intermediate term low is that low right so we have this intermediate term High to that intermediate term low this area right there that is your intermediate term range aka the range that should not fill so in between that range is where you can potentially if you want to you can draw your premium and discount on then in between this intermediate term high and that intermediate term low we now are forming you guessed it from a short-term High to a short-term low we are forming short term ranges and a short-term range always needs to have a fair value Gap in the range so from That Swing high right there to that swing low do we have a fair value Gap in that range lower yes we have so that is a short-term range AKA this high should get respected and should not get disrespected until we reach that intermediate term low we have at the bottom right there then after that we also have this short term range right there that short term high so once we have that fair value Gap in the lag we have a confirmed short term High a confirmed short-term range as well and the Beautiful Thing is a short-term High usually forms at a previous premium array so this short term High forms at what fair value Gap then this gets swept is it disrespecting that high no it's not it's respecting that high because it's sweeping it's not closing above it it's respecting it so it's sweeping that high so this high is it coming off of a premium rate yes it is does have a perfect up lowering lack on this time frame on one hour it doesn't don't justify the fair value gaps by going down in time frames when you need to justify something you go up in time frames never down in time frames because otherwise everything can be justified then after that what do we we see we have this short-term High because it now has a fair vague of lore so this high should not get disrespected before when before we reach that intermediate term low then afterwards all these Highs are they relevant yes as liquidity they could be relevant but the only thing relevant is that we are not disrespecting that high with our Gap in the leg lower and then right here what do we see we have this height that is leaving behind a new fair value Gap that already only that single fair value Gap that is already enough to tell you this is a new short-term high and that one should not get broken so this right there is your new short term High then afterwards we have a new short-term high and then we reach the Target right there if you have been following along with the other videos you know that we use a context always from an intermediate term height to an intermediate term low in between that price action that is where you want to get involved now I'm going to give you a lot of Golden Nugget so please write them down the St model is based on trading the potential intermediate term High because all you are doing with an st model is trading the first rare value Gap lower in this case which once that happens is you are trying to catch the swing height that is getting formed right there inside that fair value gap which then confirms the intermediate term high so whenever I say a potential intermediate term highest in the making that is what I mean so the SD entry is the very early entry you don't have to take that one that one is riskier the short term ranges that follow afterwards those are the highest probability trades that you can take imagine in this price action lag done right there if if you were to use the no daily bias strategy that was taught in the previous a to c episode you would have a very profitable time a great time what you're not realizing is that you are trading in fact in the middle of a market maker model because moving from this intermediate term high right there to that intermediate term low that is your context that is your marker maker model the only thing is you don't need to know it's a market maker model you don't need to know it's a power of three you don't need to know it's an AMD cycle you don't need to know it's a smart money reversal these are all Concepts that don't need to be that difficult there's literally no benefits of them being that difficult everything I'm going over here is all the concepts you could name a concept it is in the trading plan the only thing you're doing is you're not paying attention to it there's a major reason why we do that in the first place and that is something we go over inside the money making team inside the mentorship it's not that we don't understand the concept it's that we everyone here understands the concepts at such a deep level that we are able to simplify it because again every concept that you can think of is involved in this trading plan and so we know the context we know where a market maker model will likely form but still a bit vague again we are going to go over Market maker model more in depth in an upcoming video but there's two more things that I want to talk about here so right here on the daily time frame on Australian dollar US dollar what are we seeing in the weekly forecast we mentioned lower prices with this being our draw on liquidity then right here this is not the cleanest price action at the top right there but this is again the same premise we see this High then we see this high this is an official short term high Y because it now has a fair value Gap in the lag lower so this high is your last line of defense so you know based on NASDAQ as well what we just saw is you know where to take a trade and you know where to likely place your stop-loss if you can combine the time frames correctly which is what we're going to go over right now then we have a retracement and right here what do we see a new short-term High because it is a new fair value cup lower this high should not get disrespected so we first had that high afterwards that high and now we have this high right there afterwards we see another high another swing high right there is that a short term high no why not it doesn't have a fair value Gap lower so this is your new short term high right there because we have a fair value Gap sitting right there if we Mark out that verify Gap right there and we go into the lower time frame what we saw on the daily time frame were what it were short-term highs and short-term ranges what are we seeing on the one hour time frame intermediate term highs and intermediate term ranges so it's important to understand that once we take out this intermediate term low right there on a one hour basis that the retracement back into that range will 9 out of 10 times will retrace back into a PD array that is on the time frame above it so remember when I tell you the time frame you are trading on needs to be in context of the time frame above it this is what I'm trying to tell you because if you don't see that and you see this fair value got lower on a one hour time frame right there you're getting blindsided by the fact that there's a daily fair value Gap hovering just above your head it's not a fancy Turtle suit concept it's just logic so the intermediate term high that forms on the one hour will form at a premium array on the time frames above it then the same context that we have on the daily time frame where we move from daily premium array to that daily discount array is the same thing that we are seeing on the one hour the only thing is you have the daily provider right there then you have your intermediate term High to your intermediate term low right there and in between that intermediate term high and that intermediate term low that is where your short-term highs will form and that is exactly where you want to get in involved and you don't need to use the one hour for a daily survive you can also go lower that's exactly what I showed inside the trading plan then right here what do we see this St right there what are you doing you are trading the potential intermediate term height that is in the making right there the intermediate term High forms at what it forms at a premium array on the time frame above it so the one hour needs to be in context of the four hour the four hour needs to be in context of the daily means one hour also needs to be in context of your daily automatically so if there's a daily survey Gap right there then the one hour intermediate term high will form at your daily fair value Gap then once we trade into debt and we have fair value gaps lower we have an st model right there the SD model is trading the potential intermediate term high this can be done successfully if you know how to combine the time frames the second one is where we now are trade getting lower then this is now confirmed into mediate term High because we have a short-term High to the right of it and it's a short-term High why it's coming off of this premium array right there in the form of that breaker and the fair value Gap and the most important part it has a fair value Gap lower in the range right there so everything after is even higher probability and then you just follow the highs you follow the height keep on following the heist and when we do have a deeper retracement what do we retrace into something on the higher time frame right here we saw that this was a short-term high on the one hour it's not getting respect anymore why it's retracing right now to that order block with that fair value Gap as well and what forms right there your one hour needs to be in context of your four hour what is forming at that four hour premium array a one hour into me immediate term hi and this is your new one hour intermediate term High and the same exact process happens over and over and over here we are back on NASDAQ because what did I just tell you at the beginning of the video this is not an intermediate term High why not because when you look at it from a one-hour perspective it meets the criteria yes it does the first reason is we have a higher intermediate term High very close to it that is not a subjective but if we now zoom out to the four hour time frame what do we see this is just a short term high this is your intermediate term high this is your new intermediate term high it's having the one hour in context of the four hour time frame so whenever we sweep this high and that intermediate to my under one hour don't be surprised because right there on the lower time frame on the one hour on the 15 minute what's forming at that high even more intermediate term highs it's combining the tire frames so all the components we just talked about so you now know the context you know when to trade how you can get to entries as well because you're just using short-term ranges or your entries and you target intermediate term highs or intermediate term lows remember the criteria for a short-term range and now you know that if you can combine the time frames correctly and you are aware of the time frames and I don't mean combining the time frames as in you're using the two hour tire frame you're using the three hour time frame no just the one minute five minutes 15 minutes one hour four hour daily weekly monthly that's it that's all you need and now you know what it means when I say there's a potential into immediate term high in the making right there you can also try to catch that intermediate term high or you can try to catch the short-term ranges afterwards and you know where intermediate term highs form they form at PD Rays on the time frame above it because the time frame you are trading on always needs to be in context of the time frame above it now you would be absolutely mind blown how we are able to use this inside the mentorship and how we have been able to stack up a lot of assets under management in a very small amount of time you can visit either audio.io or you can scan the QR code that is on your screen right now and then I'll see you at the weekly forecast on Sunday perfect thank you thank you foreign
