allow me to explain exactly what I think is wrong with the trading industry nowadays everyone is so vague they say stuff like if you see it you can't unsee it stuff like that like what do you even mean Define seeing it what is it Define it and that is exactly what is wrong people love to figure out an algorithm people love to get tricked and stay focused on figuring out an algorithm again you know what I say I always say are you here to figure out an algorithm or are you here to make money and that's exactly why I created the money making team in the first place because a lot of people tend to lose the objective of why they came into trading in the first place it was to make money and of course to have freedom and freedom and money they are pretty correlated I could say they go hand in hand so what do I mean with vague and how can we not be vague we need to Define things so we need to objectively look at certain things and how can we make this object how can we Define it quantifiable how can we look at something and know all right this is a breaker this is a dealing range this is an order block this is my trading setup this is my entry pattern that is what the trading industry is missing it's vague it's this algorithm it's this it's this weird obsession with an algorithm the reason I say that the reason I go on this little rent it's very important for you to hear and the reason I want you to hear that is because now you need to pay attention throughout the A to Z guide I've mentioned it before everything I do is very much definable we can objectify a lot of things it's a lot of step-by-step Manner and that's exactly how I operate so in this video especially I will show you how to trade with dealing ranges I will show you exactly how to incorporate them into your trading plan because that's also what a lot of people are missing in the trading industry they show you Concepts but they don't tell you how to incorporate them because they don't actually know how to themselves the most important rent of your life right there let's get into the topic so dealing ranges what exactly is a dealing range how can we objectify this dealing range a dealing range is a range that took out buy-site liquidity and then it took out cell cycle or vice versa it took out South Side liquidity and then buys that liquidity what exactly is Buy sell liquidity again buy side liquidity is liquidity above the market so if we have current market price right here then everything above it right here this is buy side liquidity everything below it is sell side liquidity right there now we can Define it even more because Buy sell liquidity and sell side liquidity is still very vague right how can we Define it even more buy side liquidity is Swing highs sales ad liquidity is Swing lows so these swing highs that is exactly buy side liquidity these swing lows right there that is your sell side liquid so what we just mentioned was a dealing range is a range that took out buysite liquidity and then took out sell side liquidity so for example right here we have this range let me Mark it with my Fibonacci right here this is a range right is it a dealing range though it took out buy side liquidity to the left because it took out swing highs right did it take out sell side liquidity no it didn't so it's not a dealing range this right here took out buy side liquidity this candle and we took out salsa liquidity is that a dealing range yes it is so in this case what would you do you would Mark out the buy side liquidity right there that it took out and the sell side liquidity right there and this exact thing is your dealing range Buy sell liquidity taken sell side liquidity taken you could make the argument that it's somewhat of a breaker but I will show you how it is very useful that dealing range in a trading plan so that is our first dealing range now what do we see next when we continue lower what happens here is this a dealing range this High to that low no it's not a dealing range but what happens after we sweep That Swing high right there this one right there and then what is the next sell side liquidity that we are taking we first off have this already because that's obviously a swing low so we have objectified it that is the first dealing range that we have right there then the second the bigger one we could argue all right we also have this bigger dealing where we have this buy solid liquidity and dead cells I look good that is another dealing range what happens after right here we also have a new dealing range Can you spot this one also a dealing range what happens after we also have a new dealing range right there buys a liquidity taken sell side liquidity take again defining objectifying Buy sell liquidity swing highs objectifying sales liquidity between lows but leading up to those bearish dealing ranges we had right there we also have bullish dealing rates to work with so what can we see right here what happened we take out cell site liquidity right there again sales liquidity swing lows or one swing low can also be one swing low then afterwards we take out Buy sell liquidity Buy sell liquidity swing highs right here your swing high right there your swing lows sales are liquidity buys a liquidity after that we move back into the dealing range right there and then we continue higher is this a dealing range right here no it's not why because it didn't take selfie liquidity now does it mean that just because this isn't a dealing range that it won't hold no absolutely not that doesn't mean that's not what I'm implying here I'm just showing you how you can get to a mechanical trading plan using dealing ranges if you prefer that again reminder the A to Z guide here is to show you options of what you could use and you can form your own trading plan using this so if you love dealing races and you find dealing ranges very easy to spot that is exactly what you want to be using so right here we have a new dealing range right we took our sales adequately right there and we took our buy side liquidity right perfect we have somewhat of a new dealing range then the dealing range fills now you could incorporate a new thing what if we add the rule the dealing range has to have a bullish fair value gap for bullish dealing range we have to have a bullish forever Gap alright perfect let's take a look so right here we have a new dealing range to cut sales aliquity then here we took out buy side liquid and we have a fair value Gap sitting right there perfect that is our dealing range with dead cell site liquidity right there all right and we follow price we follow price and then eventually we reach that drone liquidity right there so I think you get the idea of what a dealing range now is now let's look at how we can implement this into our trading plan and how we can actually use it in an objective way now first off I need you to understand that this is also applicable to every market so I'm currently showing you Forex but it will also work on indices allow me to show you the best way of using dealing ranges in my opinion right here we are expending lower on The Daily time frame right there right we are coming into that daily fair value Gap right there with a previous day high sweep right there if we now go into the 15 minute time frame once we reach that daily fair value Gap that is exactly when we want to look for 15 minute dealing ranges the thing I'm saying here to you is you need context behind your rate and this is also a very vague subjective topic that a lot of people talk about yes you need narrative you need context what is narrative what is context Define it it is not quantifiable a lot of people just throw out words into the world like Define it it doesn't make sense and if someone is not able to Define it then just know they likely don't have a clue what they're talking about so allow me to define context Define narrative for you narrative and context starts on the higher time frame The Narrative you are seeing here is that we are coming that daily fair value Gap when we are moving from a daily fair value cap in this case a premium array the price will now seek a new discount array because price moves from premium to Discount and from discount to premium a premium array what is a premium array we have this daily fair value Gap right there and we have this previous day high but the most important part part is that daily fair value Gap right there that is a premium array where's the first discount array the first discount array is right here so this gives us our context our narrative in between this premium array and in between that discount array this little area right there that is where we want to look for 15 minute dealing ranges so this gives us our context based on the higher time frame The Narrative on the higher time frame is right there it's moving from premium array to Discount array so there is context there's narrative behind it so we don't get lost on the lower time frame trying to trade every single 15 minute dealing range that is not what we want to do so if we dive back into the 15 minutes we now have context behind what we're doing we have a narrative behind what we're doing the 15 minute doesn't create our narrative the 15 minute is just to get in sync with the higher time frame context with the higher time from narrative so we already have a place where we want to look for trades and we already have a place where we want to Target this is our Target right there that daily swing low right there what is the next step the next step is we are only trading dealing ranges so we only look at trading dealing ranges 15 minute dealing ranges right here until we reached that drama quit then we stopped looking at dealing ranges if we zoom in a little bit right here what do we see coming into that daily 5 Gap we sweep buy side liquidity right there and right here we already sweep South Side liquidity even a little bit higher you could say you could of course also say all right I take the bigger dealing range so I take this dealing range now let me first show you the smaller dealing range right here what we can see here and what we want to do is we want to enter at the low of that dealing range of course if it's a bearish dealing range so right here that could be an entry with a fair value Gap as well that is a perfect entry right there what would you do you place your stop above the dealing range and you target the Target we had established on The Daily time frame that is the first option the next option is taking the bigger dealing range a little bit more certainty maybe you are a person that wants a little bit more certainty perfectly fine then we wait a little bit longer right here the first thing we can see is we now break that low of the dealing range so we have taken sales adequity so there is a dealing range in the first place then again we enter on the low of that dealing range where do we place our stop loss above the dealing Range High right there where did we target we target that opposing daily discount array right there all right that is the second option what is the third option the third option which you see from an objective standpoint again could you see this as a dealing range right here this small little thing as a dealing range right there that range yes you could of course see that as a dealing range now what then happens is if we already moved this low would you execute on a small dealing range like that I personally wouldn't but I do agree I just talked about be it being very vague so if we make it objective let's say we took a loss right there so we took two winners and we took a loss right there all right perfect then we wait for the next dealing range what is the next dealing range we took by side liquidity here and afterwards we took sell side liquidity right there this is our next dealing range so we want to execute on that dealing range low right there the low is a little bit lower the wick right there cover what our stop loss is going above the dealing Range High starting what that opposing daily discount array right there that is using dealing ranges how you can get to a train so let's take a look at another example all right so here we are on EU on The Daily timeframe again what is the first thing we need to establish we need to establish context and narrative what is the context what is the narrative well we already have a bigger dealing range right here on the daily time frame actually that's pretty funny because then we have a fractal dealing range right here and the thing I've marked up right here is a weekly fair value Gap this dealing range what can it do it can deliver into that Weekly verify Gap because of course the weekly favor Gap will be a very strong magnet it's pulling price towards that Weekly for vice Gap in this case we also have a BPR right there a very small BPR let's just take the whole fair value Gap right there now again we dive into the 15 minute and look at our dealing ranges we haven't tapped into the daily for fire gap yet so there isn't any reason to look for dealing ranges just yet there we tap into the Daily Paragraph now my eyes are going and my eyes are scouting for a dealing range was there a dealing range right here you could potentially say there was we swept this swing high but we didn't sweep this Wing High We swept this swing high and then we swept this swing low let's just take the trade let's take the trade right there because I want to show you the reality of trading because these type of losses might happen to you and the thing is there is a losing curve in your trading this is what I tell the mentorship all the time the mentorship knows there is a losing curve in trading and the losing curve is where you first lose when you apply a new trading plan you first start losing then once you get that experience you see a couple of losses you are now likely a break even Trader then when you gain even more experience you start to taste the wins that is when you slowly start getting those profits that is a losing curve so you first start of losing then break even and then awaiting Trader but a lot of people don't get through the losing cycle they are always stuck in that first part of that losing curve where they lose they lose they lose and then what do they do they start strategy hopping Strat hopping shiny object syndrome Traders SOS Traders or the even more dangerous parties I would say where they first pass a challenge using a new trading plan a new trading strategy but they have only encountered wins they haven't had the losing part of that losing curve that losing part of the losing curve that draw down period it's going to happen it is going to happen I can tell you straight up front it's going to happen when you trade a new trading plan you will go through a losing phase that first losing phase will determine if you are an SOS Trader or not if you now start Strat hopping or not though some people get funded using a trading plan but they haven't gone through the mandatory losing stage just yet so what happens they are now funded they start losing and they think hey I shouldn't be losing trading is not about losing right who loses who's a loser you're a loser no no no I'm not a loser the market is not random we need to have 100 win rate this is very dangerous because when that happens when you have these kind of thoughts you will now look at a new training plan and you will have this endless cycle and you never get out of the losing stage and you lose your funded account because you don't understand risk management you don't understand sticking to one thing you don't have your psychology in check all things we are going to go over later on in the HC guide so right here this could be a loss all right perfect what do we see afterwards we continue we continue we do have some kind of new dealing range right there let's take it right there starting the opposing daily discount which was that swing low right there combined with a weekly verify Gap alright we take another loss minus two remember that minus two alright it seems like we might have a new dealing range to work with right here this is the load the cells are creating this is the buys a liquidity that we took right there right there we have a dealing range cover the dealing Range High Target that Weekly 45 Gap AKA That Swing low on The Daily time frame right there we are tagged in right there perfect we continue lower we continue lower then right there we have a new dealing range let's look at this we have a new dealing range let's just execute right here we execute right there we have this new dealing range right there and we target the lows again right there all right we took another loss so that is minus three right here we do have one trade still running right there there we have a new dealing range now we have two dealing ranges actually we have this small dealing range which you might have missed the trade actually right here you might have missed it right there but we also have this bigger dealing range right there so exactly there it's another trade covering what covering the dealing range a high right there targeting what starting that daily discount array all right do we get another dealing range all right here we have another huge dealing range actually right there we have another huge dealing range this huge dealing range that we have right here we again have that low right there this could be an entry right but the thing I do want to say right here covering those highs targeting again the same Target right there this is 0.6 RR is that worth it no at least a minimum of one to one RR I would say is worth it right here this is not worth it so that invalidates ID I wouldn't take that and we continue lower we continue lower we continue lower right there there we have a new dealing range targeting the same lows all right right there we got taken out perfect so we have a new dealing range here as well we have Buy sell liquidity right there taken sales allocated right there taken there it gets tapped in right there covering the highest targeting the lows and right there this take profit gets hit this take profit gets hit this Tech profit gets hit so let's actually count this 3.2 3.49 and 2.57 that is 9.26 if we of course subtract the losses from there so we took one loss right there we took another loss right there we took about two losses right there so that is around -4 but if I miss the loss let's say we are minus five all right so in these three days we are minus five but ho ho don't focus on the negative we are plus 9.26 that is Plus 4.26 for a stupidly simple trading plan and we haven't even Incorporated anything else just yet this was just dealing ranges and daily delivery you could say daily premium to daily discount daily discount to daily premium that's the only thing we incorporated here now imagine if we paid attention to kill zones if we paid attention to marked structure if we paid attention to order flow order flow is what I go very in depth on inside the mentorship and I can already tell you applying these things this loss right here would have been avoided using the kill zones already that is a minus one avoided these losses right there would have been avoided using overflow this would have been one of the very few losses so that brings us to a new end total of applying confluences and applying other things besides just the dealing ranges and the premium to discount discount premium we would come to a total of 8.26 for this single week now let me remind you you are now outperforming every single hedge fund in the world if you can keep the job consistently so the thing I wanted to show you here was that this trading industry is first off very vague people can't define a lot of things they can't seem to objectify it can't seem to simplify it this simple dealing strategy you can already tell it is profitable this on its own can be profitable now imagine if you only start using kill zones you only trade kill zones that takes away a lot of losses and the next thing is if you use the other Concepts some other concept you don't need to use everything you just use the kill zones and some marked structure and using the hard time frame zooming out zooming in you just use those Concepts combine it with dealing ranges just using dealing ranges as your entry pattern for example and that is literally all you need again I don't want you to trade this training plan first I have an idea of all the concepts that we are using first have an idea of kill zones Etc you need to First study a lot don't think that I just gave you the holy grail and you are now ready to go out there and trade no not Financial advice or anything don't trade this Trading plan please first study it study it a lot now if you want more information and if you truly like this then you will like the mentorship that we have first link in the description and if you like this then you will be absolutely mind blown with what we teach inside the mentorship again if you are interested you can take a look at that first link in the description alright thank you thank you for staying to the end and I'll see you at the next one thank you [Music] thank you foreign
