trading Turtle soups a trading plan using Turtle soups that is exactly what we are going to touch on today so first off we are going to touch on Turtle soups in Seek and Destroy conditions and then afterwards we are going to look at certain techniques that we can use using Turtle soups in trending conditions again just a small disclaimer if you want to use these trading plans that I'm teaching here don't blindly go into trading a live environment or whatever first study the absolute out of these trading models and if you haven't watched the full A to Z guide I would first recommend doing that afterwards slowly implement it on a demo account and from there on if it works for you then slowly start scaling Etc but again that is up to your own decision not Financial advice or anything but don't just blindly start trading these trading plans you need to First study that is very important once you have the ability to spot it in hindsight the then you slowly start forward testing I would not advise back testing unless you do hindsight back testing I would always advise first hindsight back testing and then or testing reason being for that back testing using the replay tool in my opinion always builds up unhealthy habits let's take a look at seek and historic conditions first and how we can trade those so first off we need to determine the range that we are actually stuck in because if you remember the previous episode seek and historic conditions happen at 50 at equilibrium of a certain range once you have determined that exact range what you want to do you want to grab your Fibonacci right there you want to draw it from the range that we are stuck in so you can see we are stuck from that high to that low and you can notice I have an equilibrium level 0.5 but I also have quadrants quadrants indicating that I have 0.75 and 0.25 you can classify the quadrants as the following from zero until 0.25 that is discount discount from 0.25 to equilibrium that is Discount premium from equilibrium until 0.75 that is premium discount from 0.75 until one that is your premium premium the place where you want to look for potential entries is when we are coming off of either a premium premium or a discount discount and you want to be targeting equilibrium again so for example if we zoom in a little bit this area or right there here we are coming into premium premium right there once we reach that premium premium we want to Target equilibrium so in that small area right there that is exactly where we want to get involved a small area again in seek any short conditions you need to understand it's called seek and restore for a reason it's not trending conditions that's exactly why we have different names for different conditions right so you can't expect price to run very far in seek and historical conditions you are not using a very large Target exactly what I'm going to show you in just a few moments so let's dive into the chart having that premium premium on our chart right there so here we are on the five minute time frame now there's a step-by-step process that we need to follow using Turtle soups here on a seek and historic manner so the first thing that we had established was arranged then we use the quadrants then we wait for either premium premium or discount discount in the meantime going into the lower time frame what needs to happen is on the lower time frame so here on the five minute time frame we need to see a Judas a Judas that sweeps liquidity then has an st model so it's a step-by-step range quadrants Judas liquidity sweep SD model entry close Target so we have our range we have our quadrants we have a Judas now does the Judas sweep liquidity if we look to the left yes it does right there we have a nice liquidity pool again how can we Define liquidity it's just swaying highs swing highs right there getting taken out now we want our St model we have first displacement lower right there we want a second one that right there that is exactly what you would want to see enter on an overlapping beat array right there covering the intermediate term high and targeting a closed Target now what do I mean with a closed Target you want to Target a liquidity pull again close to equilibrium of the range that you are trading in so what does that mean right here we had established on a daily time frame the quadrants right this right there is your equilibrium that line right there so if we zoom in again we can see we have liquidity right there beneath equilibrium now there's a few things that you can do here you can either Target equilibrium itself or a fair value Gap that is close to equilibrium or you can Target that liquidity that is sitting right there and what is liquidity it's just a swing low right there that is close to that equilibrium but it's important to understand that in seek and short conditions you are not having a very large Target and what I mean by that is you're not hoping that this absolutely drops to the bottom of the market that's not logical at all we are not in a trending environment price will likely come back to your entry right there so a close easy target a get in get out so this right there was a first entry that we could have taken this is my preferred entry there is another one you can also enter on that first fair value Gap just like we talked about in the St model video itself this is also an entry but again just because you get an early doesn't always mean it's the better entry not at all so the higher probability entry is that second one this can also be your entry but again study the SD model that we talked about and use the time frames correctly then we have a third entry if you miss this first one and you missed the second one or if you want to wait for even more confirmation then right there is your third entry but it's important to understand that there are a lot of different entry types right there it's important to understand you need to stick to one of them so either the first one either the second one either the third one but stick to one of them because in the moment when that entry actually comes to you and you don't have a clear and concise entry pattern and you don't have the guidelines for your entry pattern then those emotions will start to rise and you will enter based on emotions not on having guidelines that is backed up by data that is very important to understand you need to have one entry pattern that you can stick to every single day so if you enter right here and let's say you put your stop loss right there then again what is close to equilibrium you can either Target equilibrium itself or the liquidity right there and that would be your target again easy target getting get out it's not a trending condition so keep that in mind now what do we do after again we start all over again the trading model repeats itself again we determine the range well the range hasn't changed just yet we go over the quadrants again we can see we don't come back to New quadrants but we don't reach discount discount we don't reach premium premium anymore so right here you don't get involved unless there's a new range to work with so let's take a look at that because if we go back into the five minute time frame what can we see we just traded this range right there and then we come back up and then we go back down again and then we fill to follow through on the lows and right here we come back up again indicating that we have a new type of range because we are not following through anymore so we draw our quadrants on the new range right there and we go over the same exact process we have a range established quadrants established Judas liquidity sweep entry close Target so let's look at the quadrant again at this moment in time right here and right here you're not sure if this is a new Range because you're not sure if it's following through but once this field to follow through and fills out to take these lows then you can confidently say that this is failing to follow through it failed to follow through on the highs it's failed to follow through on the lows so if we again look at the quadrants right here and we draw the premium premium right there and we also draw discount discount discount right there now again let's follow the exact step of Judas where's the Judas this is your London session all right nice here we have London coming into it no displacement lower yet so there's nothing to work with just yet here we have an early s stay right there a very early SD would you cover this high right there no you would cover you would not suffocate your stop loss that is very important don't suffocate your stop loss give it some room to breathe right there your potential stop loss what is your target an easy target close to equilibrium where was equilibrium again let's mark it out right there debt right there is your equilibrium all right then we have a swing low right there a swing low right there we have some Eco lows sitting right there so that is already a nice Target there is a one to two and Seek and Destroy conditions perfectly fine you don't need more in seek and historic conditions we have a couple of entries afterwards as well we have that or lock right there targeting what again the same right there now it is logic cover that intermediate term High targeting the exact same I wanted to again perfectly fine afterwards we reach that Target and we head into what discount discount discount right there once we are in discount discount we can again same process Judas liquidity sweep entry close Target right here we have our Judas and we have our liquidity sweep right there for the shorts the liquidity sweep was right there Above That Swing high and on the lows your liquidity sweep is right there so we are in discount discount right there now let's look at an entry so a Judas again right here your PM session starts then we have one St right there bullish for fire gap here bullish flag up as well that is an entry right there targeting what close equilibrium any swing height that could already be your turret and afterwards this could have also been your entry covering the same low targeting equilibrium swing High close to equilibrium perfect now that is a loss so there is two potential loss that we could have taken and if we follow price action afterwards what happens again again later on in the PM session we have again a liquidity sweep right there then we have St already here a small bullish for that could already be your entry covering your stop loss again don't suffocate it give it some room to breathe targeting what a swing High close to equilibrium this swing high is already a one to two a one to two and seek and historical conditions be very content with that because that is more than enough in secret historical conditions afterwards we also have this entry right there based on that order block with the fair value Gap overlapping covering that that low right there this is also almost I want to do a 1.75 in seek and historic conditions and that late in the day where you have at last hour that hour hour a 1.75 be content with that that is nothing to be ashamed of that is actually a great great result if you can achieve that consistently and seek in historic conditions so remember what we went over range quadrants Judith liquidity sweep entry close Target once we reach equilibrium everything is invalidated and you don't look for a new entry until we reach a new quadrant either premium premium or discount discount all right now let's take a look at how we can use Turtle soups in trending conditions here we are on EU on a four hour time frame now we came into a daily fair value Gap right there then we had a lower price and eventually we had a bearish far back up to work with right there on 4 hour and this order block to work with once we had that order block if we now go into the one hour time frame and we look at a rejection right there off of that order block expecting lower prices what we can do here is enter on a one hour fair value Gap now I can already hear you think how is that a turtle soup because if we use this one hour fair value Gap right there and if we then go into the lower Tire frame and use time to our advantage because time is important why is time important again it's a very vague concept A lot of people say time is important time is important because time will exactly tell you in which PD rate price wants to sting into before we head lower so what do I mean by that if we now go into the lower time frame into the five minutes right here we start London and London stings into that one hour for Vegas and continues lower so the reason time is important right there because time will tell you into which PD rate it wants to stay into and from there it will continue lower when London Killzone open right there we first had to move down and afterwards we had a one hour fair value Gap hovering right there so if London now has a retracement higher we go and look and see what it wants to potentially sting into to which premium array it wants to sting into before heading lower with the already established context that we had which leads us to a turtle soup entry right there now why is that a turtle soup entry and why wouldn't you expect that height to hold because we have a one hour fair value Gap right there remember the saying every time frame needs to be in context of the time frame above it five minute needs to be in contact with a 50 minute 15 minute needs to be in contact with the one hour obviously then a five minute needs to already be in context to one hour if there's a one hour fair value Gap right there you can't expect that height to hold it can happen but the probabilities of it happening are very slim so a five minute swing High inside a one hour per hour gap or close to it that is your entry and this is fractal right you can also use a 15 minute fair value Gap with a one minute swing High inside of it where do you place your stop loss on a 5 minute base you place your stop loss above the intermediate term High what is the intermediate term high right here the clear concise intermediate term high right here is that I right there what do you target well you're Target was already established on a four hour basis remember what we talked about in the earlier A to Z guide videos from premium to a discount array your premium rate that you're essentially trading off of is that for our order block the discount rate that you're targeting then is a swing low on a four hour basis which is an intermediate term low on a five minute base so that exactly that is your target with a beautiful entry right there now it's important to understand the the context behind what I'm doing here because you can notice that the one hour fair value Gap right there the one hour forever Gap that's sitting right there that trade is taken before we take that draw on liquidity so inside that range from premium to discount rate inside that range is when I take the trade that is very important to understand now this was one of the techniques but you also have a technique selling on weakness and buying on strength here we are back on ES again and what we can see right here already is we have a turtle soup right there that we could have potentially entered on now of course in hindsight beautiful but what are the steps to achieving that the first thing is context what is the context here you have again it's your Judas it's your liquidity sweep it's your entry it's the same as those seeking historic conditions but you don't use a range you don't use quadrants right there the context is as well we have no perfect gaps higher in this lag up whenever there's no fair value gets higher in that lag up the odds of getting swept are already increased now it could have also gotten swapped if there were prevalent gaps in that leg and time will tell you that again what we went over time is important in that because time will tell you does it want to sweep that does it not want to sweep that doesn't want to respect the low and the reason I say that is because your entry opportunity doesn't present if time doesn't tell you anything and let me show you why right there so we go from time so at 8 30 if we go into the 5 minute time frame here we are on a five minute time frame now this is the buying on strength technique one thing you can obviously do is just place a buy limit below that low but what you need to understand if you're seeing someone on Instagram on Twitter on YouTube doing this then just know their stop loss isn't like that they don't have a they don't have a tight stop loss their stop-loss has room to breathe so yes you can enter on this but you need to give your stop-loss room to breathe so on Forex it's like a 20 30 pip stop loss on ES right here I would argue all right maybe an 8 to 10 pip stop loss so you don't suffocate that stop loss that is very important to understand and that is why I say and that is why I mentioned a lot of times Turtle soups are nice to trade and they look very fancy and you can get to a bottom right there and they feel very great your ego gets satisfied Etc but in my opinion they are not the highest probability they are not the best entries they don't give you the best RR in my opinion if you just wait there are better entries out there so right there this is one of the techniques that you could use just purely based of the Judas and liquidity sweep that time time will tell you into which discount array it wants to trade A2 again right here again if we use time we can use the buying on strength technique buying on strength technique you want to enter above the candle that was responsible for sweeping that low so what I mean by that you have this load that we were talking about then you have this down candle that was responsible because this is the one that came below that low that was sweeping the low buying on strength you place a buy stop above that candles high right there you would have gotten tagged in right there you place your stop loss below that load that potential intermediate term low right there and afterwards you target the exact premium rate that we had in mind already going into the one hour discount to premium array and the reason I say time is important and time will tell you exactly what I want to do is because let me clarify it one more time no pun intended right here 8 30 had this due to swing lower there was no entry opportunity beforehand if you use time and the Judas and the liquidity suit there was no entry even before that that is why time is important and time just thinks into that discount array into that liquidity sweep right there and then you place your buy stop right there buying on strength and then you're in and you target those exact highs now of course you guessed it on EU that we just showed you can also use the exact same methods that we went over here where you first enter on the anticipated liquidity sweep and then you use the buying on strength technique but on EU of course it was a short so you would use the selling on the weakness technique which is the exact same only of course in first it's important to understand when sick and historic conditions happen both portrays that are trying to trade second destroy conditions and Traders that are trying to avoid seeking short conditions so if you haven't watched that video just yet then write right here on the screen you can go to that video and I will tell you exactly how to spot seeking short conditions alright perfect thank you foreign
