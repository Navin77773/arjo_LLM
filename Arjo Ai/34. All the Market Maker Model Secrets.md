so today will be a huge one this video will be the highlight of the A to Z guide because we will be going everything that you need to know in order for you to trade a market maker model all the secrets all the sauce everything you can think of will be shared today and of course it's in my personal style which means that it's straight to the point and it's cutting out a lot of that you don't need the first thing that is very important to understand because I have made a list in which I go over to certain steps that we need and the first step on that list is understanding the context I believe the context is everything now what do I mean with context with context I mean that you understand where a Markov maker model will form if you can understand where a market maker model will form you can understand when order blocks will hold you can understand when certain PD arrays in the market will hold and push price higher or lower usually what you will see is that a market maker model forms only in a short period of time and what I mean by that is that the highest probability price action is not always going to be there there are certain moments in price that will be the highest probability price action will every day be high probability no will every week be high probability no will every month be high probability no it's picking out the right context in the highest probability price action and that is exactly what I'm going to show you here because that is where your Market maker model will form what I always tell people is it will feel like there will be more low probability days than there will be high probability days so when you're moving from high probability date to high probability day in between that it's patience patience for new context to form when you have the context that is where you can go crazy so on a technical level what I mean with context if we zoom out and with zooming out I mean going up in time frames the more you zoom out the easier the context will be because on a certain time frame the context is just simply moving from discount array to premium array or from premium array to Discount array depends on if we're bullish or bearish so if we take a look at this context on USD JPY on a monthly time frame now I know you've all seen this before if you've watched my previous videos you've all seen this before but this is a beautiful example and this is also going a little bit over hindsight examples but I'm also going to show you a live example which was exactly a thing we forecasted in the weekly forecast as well right here on a monthly basis we are moving from what this fair value Gap with this overlapping order block right there those are two discount arrays on the monthly timeframe so you might remember the question that I always ask myself if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from well on a monthly time frame if we are going higher we are likely going higher from this fair value Gap with that order block right there then what is our Target our first Target is what it's this high that is our first premium array eventually we can also look to Target that high but that's not relevant for now with Market maker models and understanding the context the thing that I always teach is that you don't actually need to look to the left all you need is look to the right because everything to the left here can be blurred it can become white and it doesn't make any difference zero difference all you need to know is the context which is if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from and what is our Target and that is Discount array to premium array and you can imagine because we are doing this on a monthly time frame we have a lot of price action to work with now if we combine the time frames correctly and we zoom in on this piece of price action then in two candles because this is one two in two candles alone we can know where a market maker model will form when you move from a monthly discount rate to a monthly premium array the time frame you want to be using is either a daily time frame or a four hour time frame for your Market maker model and this is the beauty because the context is just two candles you don't need a lot of candles to know what price is doing with two candles that is already my contacts so let's zoom in to the Daily time frame now you can see that on the daily time frame we have our Market maker model because moving from this discount array to that premium array right there in between that this price action that is where you want to get get involved this is your Market maker buy model and the only thing you are doing is you are trading from a discount array to the first premium array which was the monthly order block to that monthly swing High that's all it is then you can imagine if we go over context again what do we see we see the exact same thing happen on a daily time frame for example if we look at this fair value Gap right there then we can see that moving from that discount rate with the overlapping order block as well and targeting what that first premium array which is that swing High discount to premium array in between that if you combine the time frames correctly again from that discount array to that premium array right there that again is your Market maker model this is exactly what I mean when I say you're combining the time frames correct and you can see that all this price section to the left depth for a value Gap this far Valley Gap is not really that relevant the only thing relevant is alright where are we going higher from is the only thing relevant because we want to trade this expansion higher that's the highest probability and in between that price Action Moving from that monthly discount rate to the monthly premium array that is where if you can again combine the time frames correctly that is where your daily order blocks will hold that is where your daily fair value gaps will hold that is where your daily discount arrays will hold then again if you go into this from that discount rate to that premium array on a daily time frame then here if you combine the time frames correctly for example a one hour time frame that is where your one hour PD race will hold now what is the start of a marker maker model if you have the context so we're using the context from the monthly order block to the monthly premium array right there then on the daily diaphragm you would want to see an st so there is just a fair value up higher which we get right there that is already an early indication of what of the intermediate term low being confirmed now this price action right here this retracement is not as high probability as the second fair value Gap that we are creating right there this fair value Gap overlapping with that order block that is your highest probability price action that is where the fair value gaps are telling you a story and the fair Vegas are telling you yes we indeed want to go higher to Target that high right there and all that is is your new short term range so you're using the short-term ranges to get involved to Target this intermediate term high but that is a short-term high on the monthly time frame that is why combining the time frames is so important and again this being a consolidation that's not relevant that's the least of your concern the consolidation there is the least relevant all you're doing is you're targeting this intermediate term high on the time frame you are entering on so the time frame you are entering on you are targeting an intermediate term high but your context time frame is just a short-term High the same when we look at this daily Gap to the Daily swing high right there on our context time frame AKA our daily time frame right here we are moving from this fair value Gap to that just singular high so that is just a short term high but if we were to look at the one hour time frame right there what would it be of course it would be an intermediate term high and then you use the short term ranges on either the four hour the one hour to get involved to Target that intermediate term high now the funny thing is why is this context so important can you see this huge expansion that we had right there and then we had a sudden retracement on The Daily timeframe this is a scary retracement because it looks almost like we're bearish right there but all we're doing if we were looking at the monthly time frame all we're doing is coming back into a discount rate to continue knew the trend that was established on the monthly time frame and how do we know the monthly time frame wanted to go higher because the fair value gaps are telling us a story that the monthly time frame is still bullish we're just following the fair value camps there and this move is exactly what you need because after an expansion what I always talk about you don't want to chase price you want to wait for what a new retracement because what does the new retracement do it creates a new context from a new discount rate to a new premium array so don't be scared of retracements retracements are where New Market maker models will form for example here when we had this retracement a new market maker model formed when we had this retracement a new market maker model formed it's all fractal and when we do have that retracement that is exactly where you want to get involved you don't want to look at instruments that have already been expanding you want to look at the ones that have been retracing so the same exact thing when we took out that hi right there that is our Target so what do we do after first of all the fair value gaps are telling us a story right there Above This high does it seem like we are sweeping again fair value Gap is telling us a story right now it does seem like they are getting respected we are not wicking above that high we are not aggressively moving lower that is already the first indication that we might want to continue higher and Target that high now what do we need in order for us to Target that high we need new context after taking the target we've been expanding we need a retracement a retracement into what into a new discount array to Target a new premium array so we need new context what you would do after your target has been reached you zoom out zooming out again means going up in time frames you go up in time frames because if you were to use a daily time frame here it is difficult well it might not be that difficult but it's more difficult difficult to navigate than if you were to use the weekly time frame because if we take a look at the weekly time frame then we can see that it's just one simple fair value Gap right there that we are moving higher from isn't that beautiful and then the only thing you need to do is see that we can provide app and say to yourself if we are going higher where are we likely going higher from we have a weekly verify Gap there still within the monthly context we are expending higher then that discount array on a weekly basis is where we want to look for potential higher prices than that high right there is what that's our Target so between this low right there and that high akar Target this is our context again and all we're doing there all we're doing is predicting maybe one or two candles on a weekly basis and those one to two candles on a weekly basis give us a lot to work with on the lower time frame if you can understand what I'm trying to tell you here the context that is the most important part because now you know you know where order blocks will likely hold you know where breaker blocks will likely hold you know where firefighter gaps will likely hold AKA You Now know where short term ranges will likely hold because if we zoom in on this particular price action and we go into the one hour time frame then we can see that on the one hour time frame what happened after we took that Target to the left right we can see that on a one hour time frame it's very messy it's very messy and this is not above this high the first time being above that high right there all this price action this is not where your breaker block will hold where your order block will hold where your fair value get behold if anything that is what that is where price fails to follow through AKA your Seek and Destroy conditions then where will our new market maker model form if we have new context and that new context happens where when we move from a new discount array to that new premium array in between that discount rate to that premium array we will form what first an intermediate term High AKA or St that St forms where this right there that small verified that is your St that is a very early entry now is this the best entry is that the highest probability entry absolutely not I think the longer you wait the more you will get rewarded what do I mean by that the longer you wait in a market maker model of course you're not waiting until the target is hit and then getting involved but the longer you manage to wait the more patience you can have you will get reward because that will be the highest probability that will give you the highest win rate and the highest returns then right here we see it at St and what do we see after one fair value Gap two fair value gaps this is the moment where price is now confirmed to go higher because we have this new shorter term range right there afterwards what do we see short-term range right here is holding then after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range it's holding after we have this new short-term range will it hold what are we close to the draw on liquidity right there now I do want to mention this when going into the lower time frame the kill zones the news drivers the day of the week they all become more important what did we mention again when does price want to expand higher when price has volatility when is their volatility in the market when there's news in the market price needs news to expand higher which is exactly the reason why you saw this low being created when on a Wednesday what was the economic calendar doing on a Wednesday we had US dollar news and afterwards we see a again US dollar news and again US dollar news so what can we expect the volatility is right at those days when the context is also there because if we're trading blindly and we're trading this we're trading in the middle of this Seek and Destroy range then obviously the news is not relevant because we don't even have context if we don't have context we have nothing to work with now the crazy thing is that even if you have just this weekly fair value Gap and this is again being way more advanced but just by having that Weekly surviving up on your chart it first off acts as a magnet and then it acts as a rocket because price will consolidate because it's seeing a weekly Fairfax right there so price will do a consolidation here and then it will have some certain setups right there because it's targeting what it's targeting the Drone liquidity which is what the weekly Fair fire cap right there and then the weekly provide access what once we reach it it acts as a rock pocket why because now it's pushing it away and you can see pushing price away the high probability days right here they are flying by they happen quick you either get in or you miss it but the low probability days again these are what I would say they are lower probability than these high probability days they happen slowly price takes its time it's moving slowly it's doing whatever it wants it is taking out the impatient Traders that's exactly what it's doing and the inpatient Traders have already lost and blown their account in this price action before they can even get to these high probability days high probability days don't happen always you need to pick them out if you follow the steps the context the news drivers if the checklist is complete that is when we have high probability days and you can probably imagine that these pair of value gaps right there what are they doing that is when we have on the lower time frame marker maker models because moving from this fair value Gap right there to that swing high right there this is exactly the same exact context as we just saw in between that low to that high this is where your short term range is on the 5 minute will hold for example if we take this piece of price action where we're moving from that order block to this High That Swing High then from this low to that high that is where your 5 minute short term ranges will hold so let's zoom in so here we are on the five minute this is our weekly fair value Gap right there we've been pushing higher and you can see that on the five minute this price action is way more difficult to navigate here's where you would use even more so the intermediate term lows the intermediate term highs and you can see that if you just just have one singular or two one hour candles that are moving from discount array to their pre-memory then the contacts on the five minute becomes so much easier for example right here we have what we have this intermediate term High then we have a retracement into what that breaker block right there this already that down candle is coming into what that breaker block with an already confirmed fair value Gap is that a perfect entry yes it is now does this need to be your target right there you can use it a sword yeah of course you can you can but keeping in mind is the RR right there worth it is that worth it a 0.44 I don't believe so so what you can do because remember we are in a weekly context because we're in a weekly context we can go even crazier and Target that whole weekly High which is sitting right there now again I want you to understand me very clearly will will these traits happen very often no usually you will see a lot of losses a lot of break evens before you get a crazy Runner like this so just aiming for a simple one to two is all that you need it's even more than you need and you can see that every single retracement that happened on the one hour this was this one hour retracement into the discount rate the fair value Gap with the overlapping breaker that is sitting right there and it was a Target That Swing high right there based on a one hour you can see on five minute this retracement is very confusing so if you just zoom out and you make it easier for yourself all you're doing is trading from that discount array to that premium rate and in between that you are using this intermediate term height that is where your St forms then after we have a new providing up higher we have this short term range these short term ranges they will hold and you use them as your entry right there all these short-term ranges are your entries and again a short-term range needs to have a fair value Gap ideally the short-term range should also come off of a previous discount array but they need to have a fair value Gap there needs to be a verified Gap in the short-term range otherwise it isn't a short-term range just to go over this one more time as well where would you place your stop loss you place your stop loss at the place where price has no reason to come back to this right here price has no reason to come back to why because this low if we look at the one hour again that low right there that is where price already came into a previous survive Gap and already created a new short-term range higher and because that we know short-term ranges will hold until we reach that intermediate term high that Weekly Target we know that price has no reason to come back there and then after this target is hit right there what would you do on a five minute time frame that's an intermediate term high but what would you do you do the same exact thing you zoom out again because when you zoom out again and we go up in time frames you can use the 50 minutes as well but if we use the one hour time frame then right here we can see we have that breaker with that overlapping fair value Gap right there we have new context and that new context if we dive into the five minute then that new context is already where our entry opportunities happen right there so would you follow price after this entry opportunity has happened right there would you follow price based on a five minute time frame higher you could do that but you need to understand that is not the highest probability that is actually pretty low probability because a lot of times you will get caught in price action like this where we come into that for Value Gap and we just have a huge retracement lower and what does it retrace into it retraces into something that is on the time frame above it because your five minute needs to be in constantly 50 minutes your 50 minute needs to be inconsistent of your one hour so when we retrace into something on the one hour you need to be aware of that if you're just following the five minute time frame right here your five main structure then you will get blindsided and you can see here that every retracement that happens don't be scared of it because it's a new opportunity it's a new market maker model even the smallest retracement if you were to trade like the second time frame the one minute time frame then this retracement right there for example if you were to go into the even lower time frame than this from that discount array to that premium array that is your context for a very low time frame Market maker model and then in between that all you're doing is what you're waiting for that intermediate term low which is your St afterwards you're waiting for new short-term ranges which is exactly the highest probability price action where you can get involved in after we reach the target what do you do you zoom out again you go up in time frames and you wait for new contacts because then right there that is your order block and this to that that is what that is your new contact and that is where you would go go into I don't know the 30 second time frame the 10 second time frame now don't make it that crazy you don't need those second time frames it's just as an example of how fractal this is because essentially what we've just done we've worked from the monthly all the way down to even a second star frame which is the exact same all you need is that context you constantly need the context the context I would argue is almost the same as your entries because when you think about it you constantly have the same contact because here we moved from this one hour or block to that one hour premium array right there Then for an entry we are moving from this five minute order block to that five minute premium array right there which is also your context and after we have reached our Target we need to ask ourselves and this is where the fair value Gap video comes in and the video I'm talking about is the fair value gaps are telling you a secret story because right here we are on Euro GBP and this is a beaut for example if we again start off with the monthly time frame that we can see that we are moving from this monthly fair value Gap two the monthly low which was first that low and afterwards this low as well which is a clear Wing low on the weekly time frame right there so if we are moving from that monthly paradig up to that Weekly low right there then on a daily time frame of course we will have nice moves and fair value gaps holding right there until we reach that low now this is where the fair value gaps are telling you a story because if we go into the four hour time frame what do we see we see that once we reach this target we have a very aggressive reaction this reaction right there based on the fair value gaps telling you a story is this a reaction and you can compare to USD JPY what we just saw is that a reaction that you would say yes I do think we are continuing lower well we could we very well could but not right now we are clearly having a very aggressive reaction and we are clearly seeing what a market maker buy model in the making we just came off of this Market maker cell model right there and now we are creating a market maker buy model what can this marker make buy model reach for this is a different scenario because now we are moving from an external range right there we are sweeping liquidity to targeting something internal internal in the form of a fair value Gap if we zoom out we first off have a few daily favor gaps sitting right there one small one right there and one right there but what you're taking into account is the weekly time frame because here on the weekly time frame we are in the middle we are 10 hours away from creating what a weekly pair value Gap what have I told you before one two three this candle is uncertain because we already had the expansion prices in for a retracement especially after reaching a Target so that fair value Gap acts as already before it's even being created that acts as a magnet or price that fair value Gap in itself is your drone liquidity the same as what we just went over on UC JPY the for Value Gap acts as a magnet and as what as potentially a rocket so if Euro GBP wants to continue lower then it will likely do it off of that Weekly for five Gap so that Weekly for flag up in itself is a Target and it could be responsible to push price lower now again that is where more knowledge as well comes in because if we're sweeping this like this currently then is it very logical for price to continue lower off of that that is something we will discuss as well in the weekly forecast so knowing that this is our draw liquidity that is the most important part right now that if we go back into the four hour then right there what are we seeing we are seeing this SD which is creating what that intermediate your term low right there Then That St is creating what that small fair value Gap right there then this small fair value gap on a four hour time frame it's what it's your new gun text because we're moving from this low to that high so if we go into the 15 minute time frame on that particular context then here we can see we here we have no provide gaps higher but afterwards what do we create we have this provide up higher and then afterwards we also have that for Value Gap higher right there these are all potential entry opportunities and what are they they are short-term ranges again after we reached this turret what Would You Do Well to avoid ugly price action like this where it's not that clear what it wants to do Etc you would zoom out and you would look at new context what is your context here when we are moving from this four hour block even death for our profile Gap right there then what we could see is this Gunnery Creamery with this weekly fair value Gap as your target as well so that is an extra that you have that is an extra drone that could get an extra Confluence so right there you can do what you use the intermediate term low which is your St then you look for your short term ranges and your fair value gaps and you target that high now again the head is not Financial advice and again that is being very aware it is also a Friday is Friday known as a trending day what did we go over with the weekly profiles Friday is generally not known as a trending day so there is something to take into account that is why all the videos combining all the videos it's very important but you can probably see now why this is the highlight of the A to Z guide and as well what you can see is after we break it all all down that you don't need those labels the labels itself are irrelevant I could call it for example I don't know banana smoothie number two banana smoothie entry number two and it would be the same all you need to do is follow a step-by-step process and the context is important that is all you're essentially doing now combining the swing grades we went over in the previous episode as well that is how you can get to certain entries and how you can get to a certain training plan that you want to use and you can see that if you're using the swing rates on the higher time frame and then also on the lower time frame you can get to very high probability price action just a little reminder that today the enrollments are open for the master class if you're interested again scan the QR code on your screen or go to wap.com or slash audio IO the enrollments will only be open for 24 hours so tomorrow they will close again if you do miss the enrollments then of course the essential class is always open for you or a lifetime package with the most class now again disclaimer will this always work no there's a step-by-step process that you are following but you still need to understand there needs to be work done on your site it's not just that I give you this and all of a sudden you have 100 win rate all of a sudden you're a millionaire no it's about finding the right context the entries are really easy you can see the entries are not the point and that is why I went over the context because if you can understand the context that is important where these Market maker model forms I always tell people in a mentorship the entry models you can click buy or sell it doesn't matter as long as you understand the context that you are trading within because it's the context that makes the trader not the entry model the entry model choose one that you like it's getting to the right context that is the most important part in finding Mark make models and in your trading and this is exactly how you can form these contacts and how it's very fractal you can make it as crazy as you want so practice practice and practice makes perfect and if you manage to actually stick to it instead of now focusing on a new video where you have a new shiny object and you're like oh let me use this then yes I have very bad news for you if you are one of those where you consistently see a new YouTube video or someone talking about something new turtle soups I don't know and now you're thinking oh yeah let me use that because it looks way better than what I currently have then I have bad news for you because you will never get out of that endless cycle of finding that new shiny object you need to stick to something and in the beginning like we discussed as well there's a losing curve you're going to lose in the beginning and if you don't lose in the beginning you will later on experience drawdown and that's where risk management also comes in so be very aware of that again enrollments are open if you did like this video I would appreciate a like turn on the notifications subscribe do whatever you feel like doing share it with your friends fans shared with anyone who needs to see this or who needs to hear this and then of course I want to invite you to the weekly forecast on Sunday if you haven't watched any other videos on the HC guide then I would highly suggest you to do so because they will help you a lot alright perfect thank you foreign [Music]
