a New York strategy for Forex that is what we're going to talk about today we have already talked about a London strategy for Forex now we are going to talk about a New York strategy for Forex or indices I will make a separate video so the upcoming video is about enesis now the thing I want you to pay attention to in this video again we have two variables as I called it in the previous video for the London strategy there was an Asia expansion and an Asia consolidation variations today we are going to touch on a New York retracement and a New York reversal and the reason I want you to pay attention to it is because the New York retracement is the exact same thing as the Asia expansion and the New York reversal is the exact same thing as your Asia consolidation the only thing that changes is the time a lot of people think it's a whole different strategy you need to look at way other things no no no no you do the exact same thing the only thing that change is the time so in a funny way you can see that the mechanical steps that we use in this video are quite similar to the one in the London video alright so let's get into it so here on USD JPY what is the context if we move on to the monthly time frame here we have the monthly time frame and what we can see we are coming into an order block right there with an overlapping fair value Gap in the weekly forecast we mentioned this and the beauty of this monthly context is what because now on the weekly on The Daily on the four hour you already know where it is likely heading it's heading towards this height that is your opposing premium array so all this all that area on the lower time frame imagine how much price action that is your bias is set for the coming months having the monthly in context there is the easiest thing that we can have so we have that monthly order block on our chart and we know the monthly Target as well let's drop down into the the daily time frame alright so here we are on the daily and on The Daily you can see here we came into that monthly order blocker right there and this is our monthly Target so in between the monthly discount rate to the monthly premium array this area right there that is exactly where you want to get involved that is the highest probability price action right there that is the exact same as we mentioned on the previous London video where we go into the four hour you have your four hour context and you use a five minute entry and that is where you want to get evolved from the premium to the discount array it's as easy as that that is all the context you need it's important to understand when to trade so whenever we take out that high for example that is when you want to take a step back again again that can still be high probability but it's not as high probability as this price action right there and it's also the reason why a lot of people tend to get tricked when this right there happens when this huge down move happens a lot of people tend to get tricked because they're daily their weekly is not in context of their monthly time frame and on a monthly is just a continuation but on a daily time frame of course it might seem like we are very bearish right there but we're not and it's actually the opposite we are very bullish and there are high probability conditions for bullish prices right there where we can get involved so the thing I'm trying to tell you here I hope you can understand because the way you get to an entry pattern is the exact same way as you get to a bias because this exact thing when you move from monthly discount to monthly premium array that gives your bias on your weekly on your daily on your four hour when you then go into the weekly into the daily into the four hour discount arrays to premium arrays for example we have this right there this daily discount rate to that daily premium rate from that area to that area that is where you want to get involved it's all fractal it's all fractal you can make it as crazy as you want if you want to use one minute PD race with a one second entry pattern then you can do that but is it optimal no I would go up in time frames now if we go into that daily area right there the daily or block with the overlapping fair value Gap and go into the four hour here we are on the four hour and you can see the exact same context the same lines here we have the daily or block that Dave for Vega was right there the daily premium rate that is our Target and as well the monthly Target is also still sitting right there and on the four hour weekend notice if I zoom in a little we have this fair value Gap being created remember the St model that fair value Gap is already enough to trade off of just that singular fair value Gap so even on the four hour basis that could be your entry but again that's that's a whole other topic let's focus on the New York strategy and then right there if we zoom in and we go into that four hour fair value Gap and we go into the five minute time frame here we are on the five minute time frame and you can see this line on the left right there that is your daily order block with that overlapping daily for Vega that we saw and this gray area this gray box that is your four hour five value Gap can you notice something can you notice how fractal this is because the thing we saw on a daily Tire frame that I mentioned in the monthly context all the way at the beginning when we had a huge move down on the daily time frame the exact same thing we are seeing on a five minute here a lot of people tend to get spooked they tend to get overwhelmed because they don't understand the time frames above it and what is the context again it all started with the monthly so the monthly is bullish we're coming back into a daily order block into a daily fair value Gap the four hour creates an st model this fair value Gap if we are going higher where we likely going higher from that or our fair value Gap the only thing we need to do is in that four hour fair value Gap we need to look for a five minute entry pattern the exact same things we talked about in a London strategy video the only thing we need to do there is a look for an entry pattern that's all we need to do so you can see here that me giving it names so this would be a New York reversal why is it a New York reversal because a London law was right there it's around here London low was right there so London didn't make the low of today if London makes a low of the day and New York respects that low then you have a New York retracement this is a New York reversal how can we know that higher time for PD race your higher time for videos and again that can also be your 15 minute PD race if you are taking one minute entries that can also be your 15 minute PD rates but just make sure that 15-minute PD race are in contact with the one hour if you want to use one RPD race perfectly fine but just make sure the one RPD rays are in context of the four hour PD Rays because you have a 5 minute fare value Gap right there Why didn't it get respected well there's a four hour for Value Gap sitting right there just below it so this is all your liquidity so we come into a higher time for PD right here in New York that is important to understand and we come into it in New York then here we have our St model right there this could already be an entry but let's use the same premise that we used in a London video using overlapping PD Rays then right here you might not have gotten involved perfectly fine so what do we do we wait we wait for what we wait until we do have an opportunity so either it comes lower a bit lower until we reach that breaker block with the overlapping for Value Gap or we use this or block right there with that overlapping fair value Gap now what is our first Target well the first Target is intermediate term height intermediate term High aka the opposing premium Ray on a four hour basis which was this high right there now is this a very fruitful RR no it's not alright now can we cover this low right there well is the five minute right there in context of the 50 minute not just yet because we haven't taken a look at the 15 minute so if we take a look at the 15 minute we can see that the 50 minute came into that fair value Gap as well so the 50 minute also creates this swing low now again it's important to also look at to one hour so it's the 15 minute in context of the one hour the one hour didn't have any favorite gaps just yet so there's no reason for the one hour to retrace right there so what we did right there that's important to understand we had a checklist and we went over the checklist we went over our mechanical steps and we saw there's no reason for price to retrace so we can place our stop loss at that five minute load that we had right there so that is a perfectly fine stop loss placement now you can see the RR without suffocating the stop loss there's no reason to suffocate when I say suffocate you can Define suffocating by placing your stop loss at a place where price still has a reason to come back that is suffocating your stop loss there is the definition of suffocating your stop loss right now you can notice we already have a 2R just aiming for that high on a Monday on a Monday and if you're in a mentorship if you're in the money making team you know what I always tell people on a Monday Mondays are not there for you to aim for the moon they are there to build up your confidence or destroy your conference and the way you destroy your conference going into the week is by aiming for a ton of RR and taking losses and break evens all the time on a Monday that is setting yourself up for failure for the rest of the week Monday easy targets easy profit high probability trades to build up your confidence going into the rest of the week the Monday either makes you or breaks you so this is an example of New York reversal how did we know by knowing the higher time frame PD race and you can see the similarities because if I didn't mention to you that this was New York and if I mention to you that this was London then this would have been your Asia consolidation London variation it would have been the exact same there's there's literally no difference the only difference is that the time changes you might perceive it different but it's the same it's the exact same now let's take a look at New York retracement and we don't need to go that far because if we take a look at the same exact price action here on UC JPY on the four hour we still have the exact same context we have the monthly Target right there this is your daily order block this is your daily Target this is your four hour your value Gap right there then what do we notice then later on on Tuesday we have this for our fair value Gap sitting right there and now let's go into the five minute time frame again right here we noticed that London right there is coming into that higher time for PD Ray already and London already had what a displacement higher what is the displacement again defined it's a fair value Gap so the difference between the example we just saw and this example is what London in the previous example didn't come into an higher time from pdre that was in alignment with our targets Etc and with our context here it did do that so what do you you do again can you take out this London low yes it can of course it can who am I to tell price it can't right of course it can but what do you do what are the steps again in New York you now wait for a bullish fair value Gap higher where is your bullish program in New York New York starts right here on that candle this right there is your first bullish fair value Gap so that right there could already be your entry or even higher right there which low do you cover you cover this low right there that is your intermediate term low in New York and again what are your targets your targets are that height that is your four hour opposing premium array AKA your intermediate term high right there and of course you can tell again that the RR is not that great so what do you do on a Tuesday you can potentially aim for more but what you can also do is refine your engine because as you can notice we are not entering on overlapping PD Ray right there so either we have to have a little bit more patience and we enter off of that order block where we also have that for Value Gap and we covered that a low and that already increases your RR to two just make sure that you have a set entry pattern that you can always rely on and you repeat day in and day out you don't change it if you change it then there will be confusion because when you get to that entry pattern and you need to actually enter and you don't have a set entry pattern you will confuse the absolute living out of yourself and the emotions will start to rise and you will think oh do I need to enter on this or block do I need to enter on this fair value Gap it's destined to fill it it's ineftable you're going to mess up and the beautiful thing that you now might have noticed what is this this is the exact same as Asia expansion we just called New York retracement why because it's in New York but nothing changes the only thing that changes is the time it's it's truly a beautiful thing it's all fractal and once you notice this the fractality of everything that we mentioned it's absolutely beautiful and I'll mention it again your new week opening app your Reaper fair value Gap your AMD your power three even your Market maker model which we'll go over into later as well don't worry your silver bullet F re thing you can think of is already in this trading plan alright on that note I am back from vacation so thank you all for your patience we will be having our weekly forecast again this Sunday I'm very excited to talk with you all so this Sunday 8 30 again coming weeks as well 8 30 live stream right here on YouTube so the time has come if you haven't watched that London video just yet please do watch it and if you have watched it go watch it again because now you can see it's basically the exact same thing the only thing that changed is the time right here on your screen you can tap the video and you can watch it alright perfect thank you foreign [Music]
