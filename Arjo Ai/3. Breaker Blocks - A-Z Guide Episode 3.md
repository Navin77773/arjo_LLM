hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back this is the third video and this video we are going to touch on Breaker blocks breaker blocks are often confused with mitigation blocks last episode we talked about mitigation blocks and the type of pattern the mitigation block has now the mitigation block has a swing failure pattern now the breaker block as I've mentioned in the last episode as well are the breaker pattern obviously it's already a name breaker pattern and swing failure patternso swing failure pattern is for the mitigation block and a breaker pattern is for the breaker block so if we take our line tool right here let's say we have an up move right here we have a down move then we have another up move takes out this high then we have another down move takes out this low to the high and low gets taken then we move back into the low of this bearish breaker block and then we continue lower that's a breaker pattern and of course this is a bearish breaker pattern so the important thing for us to understand iswe are taking a swing high again if you don't know what a swing high is yet we'll touch on it later we are taking a swing high and we are taking a swing low and then we move back into that range this down candle if it's a bearish brake block we use the down candle and then we drop lower now if we want to draw a bullish breaker block it would look something like this so we have our low we create some sort of Swing High we take out the swing low we move back above the swing High the high right here the up candle getstraded back into and then we continue higher that's a breaker block now can you see the difference between a breaker block and a mitigation block the mitigation block would be somewhere around here because that's your swing failure pattern first breaker then after we might get a swing failure pattern and the logic behind a breaker block is pretty similar to the mitigation block if we are coming down right here and there are people buying this leg up so once we drop down below this low people who bought here get a chance tomitigate those orders so they get a chance to release themselves price is offering fair value after they had a chance to mitigate those orders price will drop off again now let's dive into a chart and give you some real-time examples as well alright so the first example right here is a bearish example we were coming off of some sort of weekly premium array now I'm going to basically emphasize more on confirming a higher time frame premium and discount arrays because a mitigation block an order block a breaker block every PD array isuseless if you don't have a higher time frame narrative a higher time frame bias so we need to have a higher time frame PD array and then in the lower time frame because the the same stuff happens on the lower time frame on the lower Terrapin we can confirm that PD array with another breaker block a mitigation block an order block Etc so weekly premium rate right here we are on the one hour time frame and you can see the pattern right here we are dropping lower creating this swing High right here a swing low we take the swingHigh immediately drop down below and we take this swing low as well then this right here this Wick that's overlapping with the fair value Gap this down candle becomes our bearish breaker block now the entire breaker block is the consecutive down candle so this is your entire breaker block just like an order Block it's the consecutive Down Candles for mean threshold it would be this right here the bodies of the candles and these ideally shouldn't get disrespected now there's a thing with means wrestled and I get this questionvery often mean threshold if it gets disrespected like this just a little close Above This doesn't mean that the whole ID of these Breakers invalidated the 50 the mean threshold is just an early indication that's all it is but the bearish arguments here are still stronger than the bullish arguments so there's no reason here to think if price closes just a little bit above it then the whole ID is invalidated that wouldn't make sense so remembered it it's not something set in stone it'sjust an early indication now we have the pattern obviously we have this breaker pattern we take the low right here because it's a barrier breaker block and then next step is something overlapping so as you can see there is a fair value Gap overlapping now this is often referred to as a unicorn setup a unicorn setup is a breaker and a fair value Gap overlapping with each other so at this low there's a fair value Gap overlapping with the breaker that makes it even stronger just like we talked about in the previous episode ifthere is another PD array overlapping with another PD array or there's something nested inside of here so here might be a very low time frame or block then that makes the PD array even stronger because then you have multiple confluences instead of having one and then you can see we move away eventually now what happens here this is a mitigation block swing fill your pattern it's coming back to this low this Wick is overlapping with a volume imbalance I would count that as a very Gap of course do your own testing see whatyou prefer and then after touching this mitigation block it drops off again this is your swing through your pattern so we had our breaker pattern right here then here we have our swing failure and this creates a mitigation block now again remember the steps and again a breaker block is strong especially with an overlapping for feiger if your bias is correct so if you know where price is trading to obviously obviously everything will be strong if we know where it trades to but without a higher time frame context behind anythingyou can have a hundred one minute time frame breaker blocks but they will not be strong if there is no context there's no narrative there's no higher time frame bias that's very important for you to understand and that's where a lot of people struggle with and it's relatable as well because I've been there as well in the beginning you're just trading the one minute and you're trading every break block you see without any higher time frame context whatsoever and you just get blindsidedand you're thinking why isn't it working well maybe you're not even looking at the higher time frame if we know the orders are on the high time frame why do we ignore the higher time frame that's stupid alright so let's move on to the next example right here we can take a look at the monthly actually and if we take a look at the monthly right here we can see we are coming off of this monthly order block if we then drop down into the four hour so that's already our context at monthly order block that's interesting to seesee how price is all fractal it's all fractal so first we have some kind of move right here but let's just ignore this bit right here and let's move on to this can you spot the breaker this last up move we create a swing high and we take out this swing low we Wick below it we have an immediate displacement higher taking out the swing high right here then this right here this little body the up candle is our breaker the wick isn't overlapping the top of the wick isn't overlapping with any of your value gapsso we take the body right here we trade back into it and we displays again so we have our pattern we take the high and what do we have an overlapping verify Gap making it even stronger and we have our bias already based off of the monthly so we have a monthly bias or for our lines with that bias we have a breaker block right there then if we drop into the lower time frame right in this section we can see the exact same thing it's all fractal so if we take a look at this right here this is our four hour breaker cominginto a monthly order block four hour breaker what are we seeing right here we're coming into this breaker for our breaker on the five minute time frame we're moving higher this Hive fails to take out this low what is this high after we take out this high right here this high is now not a breaker a mitigation block this is your swing fill your pattern breaker pattern swing fear pattern these are the only two patterns that are in the market that will tell if the market is reversing or not it's either a swing for your pattern or abreaker pattern these are the only patterns so let me write that down for you so it's either a swing failure pattern the mitigation block or a breaker pattern a breaker block that's all you need to know how to spot when a market is reversing these two patterns are the only reversal patterns so right here this is a swing failure pattern what is overlapping with this mitigation block we have this Gap this volume imbalance below it is a little fair value Gap and you can see we are pushing higher after thatsee how this video already gave a lot of information and the breaker is not that difficult to spot just train your eyes to see it and see it having it in the right context that's important see how we just had this order block we only knew about order block breaker block mitigation block and we just add a trade opportunity right here only by knowing order block mitigation Block Breaker block the only three things we talked about so far and we just had a trade opportunity right here see what I'm saying you don't need a lotto be profitable here the order block mitigation Block Breaker block already gave your bias you don't need to know a lot to be profitable now last example right here we're coming off of this previous order block like we talked about it's overlapping with a mitigation block and right here we are taking this swing high so we have the pattern we have a swing low swing High we take the swing low take the swing High bullish breaker as soon as we take so we don't need to close above it of course that's a nice Confluence to haveas soon as we Wick above this high this breaker block gets confirmed so we can already expect higher prices as soon as we trade back into it here we can already expect higher prices so pattern a high overlapping verify again see how we sting into the forefather Gap right there and push higher can you see how these three PD arrays the order block mitigation block break block already gives you so much context alright now for you please go ahead and study the breaker block see how order block mitigation block and breakerblocks already give a lot of context already can give you your bias and then I'll see you in the next video on Friday alright thank you
