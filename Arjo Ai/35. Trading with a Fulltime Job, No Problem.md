swing trading is a lost art I've been having some great suggestions by a lot of people through my email through my Discord that I've been saying what happened what has happened in the past couple years because people used to talk always about swing trading and then all of a sudden the scalping the faster action got introduced and all of a sudden all the people jumped on the bandwagon to scalp to day trade instead of Swing trading again there's nothing wrong with that but the reality of things is that a lot of people are just busy throughout the day they don't have time to sculpt they don't have time to day trade which is completely normal so in that case you're almost a little bit lost you're like what should I do everyone is sculpting everyone's day trading how can I get to a swing trade it's not talked about enough nowadays now since everything I do and since everything I teach is very fractal I'm going to go over exactly how you can get to a swing trading plan even a position trading plan sure short-term trading plan where you hold trade over potentially even a couple of hours that would be the shortest term but think about a couple of days think about catching the weekly range think about even catching the monthly range you can make it as crazy as you want to and I'm going to show you how so inside the mentorship as well this is something I go very in depth on because you need a unique trading plan that fits your time schedule and fits your personality so if this fits your time schedule and it fits your personality then this is perfect for you now first off I have a notion prepared for you the notion is in the link in description if you could please pause the video here and open that notion I will also show it on my screen in a bit I will show what I'm talking about but if you have the notion on just another screen next to you then that would be very helpful alright we start off with we are always trading either in a monthly weekly or daily context if you're not sure what I mean or what I'm aiming at with context then I would highly advise to after this video watch the previous video which was on Market maker models now again you don't need to exactly know what Market maker models are as long as you understand the context let's say that we have a monthly context now I'm sorry to bother you again with UC JPY but this is such a beautiful example and this is exactly the high probability price action that you would want so let's take a look at this price action right here if we take a look at this monthly verify Gap right there and this monthly order block right there if we are continuing higher we are likely continuing higher off of that monthly or the block and a monthly fever right so we already have our monthly context because the monthly context is that we are going higher off of this discount rate and we are targeting this premium array right there in between this low to that high right there that is where we want to get involved but how are are we getting involved if we go into the four hour on this particular price action right there here we are zoomed in on price action on 4 hour now I'm using the replay too I want to show you and take you to the thought process because you can see there is no confusion if you have the context correct again the context will take practice but the entry model itself there is no confusion at all so what do we do once we reach our discount array right there the monthly discount rate the first thing we wait for is a bullish verify Gap right there only a bullish for Vega right there that is our SD again there's a separate video on that as well that SC again you don't need a Microsoft to shift just a bullish for Photograph right there on the four hour time frame before going into the four hour time frame or any time frame that I want to execute on I already know the steps that I want to take because it's context that context can be defined even more because inside that context we have our PD array that we want to trade off of and we have our longer term Target then the entry time frame that is where we want to have an st that first fair value Gap then we want to have a second fair value Gap coming off of a discount array which is just your short term range which we talked about in a market structure video so St new short-term range off of that SC overlapping pdra that is where we want to enter that is called your original entry so let's skip price a little bit right there we have a new fair value Gap higher than we want to enter on the first overlapping part the first overlapping part is that for Value Gap with that order block right there where do we place our stop loss our stop loss is always on the original entry type it's always beneath this intermediate term low or of course an intermediate term high so again it's a step-by-step process context which leads to your PD array that you want to trade off of that context also leads your target inside the PD rate that you had a stab because of the context you want to look for your St new short-term range overlapping PD array that's where you want to enter you cover the intermediate term low or the intermediate term high and you Target around 1 to 2 RR what do I mean with around one to two RR sounds very vague right it's not so if we draw R2 out and we go to one to two RR what is close to the one to two RR right there we have some kind of order block and we have that fair value Gap so either what you can do and again this is personal preference you gather data on this and you see what suits you the best then right there what I would advise you to start off with is just a one to two nothing more just make it easy for yourself just a one to two you don't need to talk to the left only thing you need to do is one to two once you can get more advanced and you gather the data around it then you can potentially look at targeting even more but we start off with a one to two now right here we get tagged in right there we experience some drawdown perfect and then eventually it hits our Target in the meantime there's more things that I want to go over because ideally when you are swing trading so every single entry that I will show you ideally you want to be entering on a Monday Tuesday or a Wednesday again a Monday if we have the news going for us like we talked about in news episodes or a Tuesday where we have news or Wednesday where we have news that's your ideal scenario then of course once we are in the trade what are we looking to do we are looking to manage our risk inside the notion you will see that I have a rule go break even when price has no reason to return based on a lot and flood lot again remember it's less live defense plot is first line of defense So based on flood and lot when can we go break even right here we've been tagged in right there we have this new fair value Gap higher right there this entry where we just entered right there and we have this lag hire this new short term range from this low to that high is there a reason for price to come back to our entry and then go higher yes because based on the first line of defense we have this breaker right there sitting at our entry and we have this fair value Gap right there and the last line of defense is way beneath our original entry so yes there is a reason the price can return to our entry right there then if we follow along with price action eventually we will see we have a new fair value up there we have an order lock there now there's no new swing low being created so there's no new short-term range this is still your short-term range is there a reason for price to come back to your entry right there yes there is so what do we do we follow again the new short-term range this new short-term range from this low to that high what is your first line of defense that's for very Gap afterwards you have this order block right there you have this mitigation block as well right there and this is your last long defense that last line of defense is it above your entry is there a reason for price to come back to your entry right there no there is not so at this moment in time once this fair value Gap right there so let me show you this fair value cup has been created right there that is when you go break even why this revive Gap and not that for Value Gap because this for Value Gap is above that high to the left right there that is when you go break even because based on that on the short-term ranges and on the flood and the lot there's no reason for price to do this you don't keep your stop-loss at these lows at the intermediate term low just because you're like oh I don't know it might do something like this and then go to your heart I just want to take the win I'll do whatever it takes I just want to win no go break even please protect your Capital it's very important so this right here is the first entry which we call for a monthly context this is your original entry after the original entry has played out you either miss the trade and it played out or it played out and you were a part of it no either one of those what you want to do is you now want to zoom out and you want to go up in time frames when you go up in time frames we again have a step-by-step process because we're still trading the same exact thing from the monthly context that discount rate to the premium array right there the thing you want to do is what you see in notion it is called the re-entry opportunity it is important to understand that first the four hour opportunity already happened 4 Hour entry is either missed or you are already Break Even or it already hit take profit so you need to be at least break even that's the minimum then you want to zoom out to the Daily time frame enter on the overlapping part of the short term range cover short term low slash short term high now right here it is pretty vague because right here we don't really have an overlapping part we have somewhat of a short-term range but it's still part of our intermediate term low perfect let's not take this trade let's wait let's wait until we have a new short-term range this right here is what it's our new short-term range so we have a signal an alarm goes off and right now we want to pay attention because now we follow the steps again we enter on the overlapping part of the short term range the overlapping part is right there because we have this first line of defense then the overlapping part right there overlapping is always a fair value Gap with another discount rate so it's either a fair value Gap with an order Block Breaker block or mitigation block and we have this last line of defense right there so we already know we want to enter on the overlapping part right there that is our entry and we cover what we cover the short term low or the short term high of that short term range which is initially that low right there now once we target this High what can we see it's a 0.8 0.8 RR in this case you are also allowed to cover only the bodies of the candles right there then your target is the context high or low so in this case we are trading a monthly context so we are using the monthly context high or low and of course the target is the monthly context a high right there then again same thing we go break even when price has no reason to return based on lot and flood so right here we get tagged in right there and we torque those highs now again what you can do it's important you can Target on the re-engy a 2R as well but you don't need to Target because if you already wear a part of the first move then it's perfectly fine to just Target that monthly high but this is also where your data Gathering Etc comes in the only thing that I want you to understand you can for sure Target just a one to two right there you can do that but I want you to be Break Even once we reach that original Target in form the monthly context High you need to be break even right there whatever happens after it's fine as long as you break even So eventually we reach that original Target and then eventually we are still in the motion to continue to that one to two RR right there this is a trading plan on the monthly context but we also have a weekly context trading plan and we also have a daily context trading plan and each of the contexts can be defined by you have your original opportunity your original entry and the re entry and they're all the same they're just fractal so let's go over the weekly context and the daily context as well alright weekly context so if we zoom out to the weekly we have this verify Gap right there we have that order Block it's just important to understand the weekly context right here is that we are moving higher from that discount array on a weekly basis and we're targeting that original high right there that discount rate to that premium array that is exactly your weekly context now again it's important to understand I am doing it in this order the monthly context to the weekly context to the Daily context that is the highest probability but if you only have a weekly context then that's perfectly fine if you only have a daily context then it's also perfectly fine as long as it's high probability a high probability meaning that you're Scouting For the pairs for the instruments I have a list of the pairs inside the Notions a list of the instruments that you will be going over and you will be going over them and scouting those pairs and scouting the price action on those instruments and seeing on The Daily weekly or monthly what is the highest probability instruments that I can trade for the coming week so that is something that is a process you would do on the weekend and then when you're truly busy throughout the week the only thing you need to do is you need to focus on we're coming into that context area so the pity array and we want to look for our entry model that's all it is the hard work is done when you do have the time on the weekend to look at the highest probability instruments that you want to be trading now again it's important to understand you don't execute on multiple pairs all at once be careful with your risk maximum two percent risk at the time so that means if you're risking one percent on every setup then there's only two setups that you can take at that time if you're already in a trade with one percent risk then you can only take a maximum of one new trade so that is how you find the pair and that is where the hard work is done the hard work is when you do have the time again I call it hard work but it's truly not hard work it takes me literal seconds to see if a pair is high probability now again you might not have that experience just yet and you might take some more losses in the beginning which is completely fine you need to understand that that is part of the process so accept that you need to accept that fact all right if we go over the weekly context our original entry is again one hour St Plus for Value Gap plus overlapping entry then we have a cover intermediate term low slash intermediate term High Target 2R minimum go break even when price is no reason to return based on lot and flood so if we use the replay tool right here we go into the one hour and we wait for price to come into that Weekly verify Gap here we are on the one hour time frame and prices just came into the weekly fair value Gap right there where we expect prices to move higher because we have that context discount array to pre-mumorate first thing we see is an st right there the next thing we need is a new short-term range so that is where we have a new short-term range now we're waiting and we want to enter on the overlapping part we have this overlapping part right there that high with the for Five Guys overlapping so we enter off of that that is our first entry but what you'll see we create a new short-term range higher when that happens you follow along with the short-term range until you do get an entry opportunity right there and the RR is still worth it so let me explain what that means right here you would enter on the overflapping part again you cover the intermediate term low again you can cover the bodies right there that's perfectly fine and then you target a one to two which is sitting right there start off with one to two it's perfectly fine afterwards what you're seeing is you have new ranges higher and your way to go break even now let's say you missed this then you go over the checklist was there an opportunity yes they're already he was an opportunity so you don't enter again you don't follow the short-term ranges again you would not take a new entry right there for example that breaker with the value Gap it's not a one hour entry you would take and then once the original entry has happened and we could see that it is a hit or take profit right there then what do we do we now go into the four hour time frame because re-entry for the weekly context one hour opportunity has already happened one hour entry is either missed or your break even or of course you hit take profit Etc that doesn't really matter zoom out to the 4 Hour time frame enter on the overflowing part again same process that we did on the monthly context four hour right here and let's not forget when would you go break even on this trade right here this is where it's more difficult to decide to go break even but again I'll explain to you when I would go break even after this candle higher we are closer to the Target right there then we are to the entry right there now again based on lot and flood right there there's our lot and this is our plot that for Value being created or even in the meantime that breaker right there then we do have a reason to come back but based on your logic all the videos that we have gone over is it logical for price again when it's close to the Drone liquidity right there when it's close to your target as well for price to come all the way back down there and then go higher no so you go break even right there when you see it's close to your Target and the lot is just just below your entry right there this is still where you would go break even and afterwards what do we do we look for our re-entry so the same context and we look for our re-entry we're entering on the short term range so we skip price we have a first short-term range right here but again let's wait for a new short-term range if we do get that we don't get a new short-term range and we take out that Target before getting a new short-term range perfect we missed a potential entry opportunity right there perfectly fine you will miss more entry opportunities this will not be the last time but you will miss an entry opportunity the important part is once that Target has been taken what did we talk about again you need new contacts always there needs to be context that is the main premise behind everything then for our last one our daily context if we go and look at the old price action what we just saw actually if we go look at the same context that we had we were inside a monthly context and we had this daily short-term range right there and then right there we go into the one hour time frame here we are in that daily context because we're moving from a daily discount to that daily premium array right there so that is our Target now we wait again for our one hour St plus verify Gap plus overlapping entry right there we have our first St but we didn't get a new short-term range higher so we wait then right here we have our first St again because you would count this as a new St once we take out that first St right there and you wait you wait for a new short-term range higher that is where we have a new short-term range higher so you want to enter on an overlapping part anything with a fair value Gap that is overlapping with either a high or whatever it is then right there since this high is what it's already overlapping with because inside of that High inside this is what there's a fair value Gap sitting right there which we'll do now is you cover again the bodies of the intermediate term low right there and then if there's an opportunity for one to two RR then we take the trade and we see there's not an opportunity right there for one to two so 1.71 now since we are still in the monthly context I would allow it to charge that 1 to 2 which is just above that high right there only because we are still in a bigger context and then again it's important to ask yourself did you already take the daily trade based on a monthly context or are you just taking this one hour trade based off of the daily context inside that bigger monthly context whenever you have context in context in context so you have your daily and context of the weekly and the weeklies and context to monthly that is the highest probability price action so right here this is something I would allow that is valid in my opinion after that when do we go break even perfect this is already a perfect opportunity to go break even close to the Drone liquidity would we expect to come back to that tiny order block right there to then continue higher no of course not doesn't make any sense so right there we are break even so what can we do we can actually look at already a new entry opportunity on the four hour and in the four hour what are we seeing we have this right there let me remove the one hour right there let's remind ourselves or what of what our Target is which is right there that is our one hour Target let's remove the entry and let's look at a four hour entry because now we're doing the exact same thing for our entry we enter on the overlapping part which is that high with that overlapping fair value Gap right there and we cover the short-term range which is that low right there and our Target is that high now again since we're in a monthly context could we go for a one to two here as well yes we can we can even use the same exact targets that we had right there but what if this target hits and then all of a sudden it goes back to break even of course that could happen so just use the original easy target right there and make sure you profit off of one of those trades and then eventually this one hits take profit right there and then after another while this one hits take profit as well this is exactly a swing trading plan this is called the swing trading plan Lost Art again the
