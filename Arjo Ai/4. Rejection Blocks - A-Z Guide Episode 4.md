all right hello everyone I hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video we are going to be touching on rejection blocks so we've had breaker blocks mitigation blocks and Order blocks that's a lot of block now like I said as well you don't need to know every concept to become profitable so just pick out a few Concepts that you like and then stick to them because this is the only way you can actually reach Mastery if we truly want that intuition that God feeling to take over and we areconstantly hopping from this concept to that concept to this concept to that concept then we are not submitting to time and we are not allowing that intuition at a Mastery to eventually take over and that's very important for you to understand and this might be a little rant but if you're not listening to these rents and you're just here for the concept and that won't help you because trading is not about Concepts the concepts are your guidelines they are your toolbox but at the end of the day it all comes down topsychology and sticking to one thing is all about psychology it's not about Concepts alright without further Ado let's talk about rejection blocks right here rejection blocks are fairly simple a rejection block and the way I like to see them is when we do have a long Wick at the top or at the bottom for example this right here we have a long Wick then we might not sweep above so we might not take out this whole Wick before we continue lower why is this well we know generally and especially when we'retrading cfds then every broker will have a little bit of a different price action but generally on these Brokers the bodies will be the same because that's where the most volume of the trading is going to happen and the Wicks the Wicks are purely for manipulation so the Wicks are to take you out they are there to manipulate price and the bodies tell the story so the liquidity is actually above the bodies not necessarily the Wicks so right here if we take a look at this example we take the highest candle sothis is the highest gonna wear it as a close or the open this is the highest candle that is your rejection block now the reason I like it the most is because we have this long Wick that's when I do like a rejection block the most when there's a long Wick so you can see price here swept above this body and then drop lower it's taking out or it's even tricking in new people and then it's doing the exact opposite so breakout Traders got long here and people their stop losses got taken out before the real move happens now asyou might notice rejection blocks are mainly on the outside so they are either all the way at the top or either way all the way at the bottom not necessarily in between price not in the middle somewhere so this right here when we trade above the body but not above the wick and most of the time we trade inside this long Wick and then we drop off alright so this is a bearish rejection block again you take the highest candle now if we take a look at a bullish rejection block I can already see one right here right herethe lowest candle it's a rejection block as well it sweeps the bodies but not the wick again it's a long Wick that's when I like to use rejection blocks when it's a long week and as well as you may notice the main Trend right here was bearish right we were going down obviously hindsight 2020 Vision but the main Trend was going down generally when we are moving against the trend so this is also the opposite Trend move right here a counter Trend move then we will not always sweep below the low wewill generally respect rejection blocks more again that's for yourself and see if you like it and then maybe you can look to implement so right here same thing right rejection block right here the lowest candle we sweep below the body but not below the wick then we continue higher again a pretty long Wick as well and same thing like we just mentioned it's going against the trend so it will not always take out this low of the wick it might just respect the rejection block right here and as well it's an outsidercandle it's sort of at the bottom instead of somewhere like here in the middle for example same as here somewhere at the bottom it made a swing low which we'll get into later on and then we respect the rejection block and continue higher alright last example right here another bearish example same exact thing right the highest candle in this case the down closed candle is a little bit higher so the open of the down close candle is a little bit higher than the close of that up candle again long Wick it's onthe outside it sweeps the bodies and then continues lower so that's mainly all there is to it don't over complicate it this is literally all you need to know about rejection blocks so go ahead and study them for yourselves and I'll see you in the next one alright thank you thank you foreign [Music]
