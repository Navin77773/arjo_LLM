so getting funded and making actual money now why should you trust me you don't need to first off you don't need to trust me at all I am a private Equity Trader and I have been funded before I know what it takes I've also blown accounts I've blown challenges I've passed challenges I've been there all before now what I always like to tell people is just because I can do it doesn't mean I necessarily can teach it well because when someone can do it it doesn't always equate to being a good coach a good teacher so I would like for you to judge me off of the way I teach and what my students have reached so far because everything I have achieved is irrelevant if my students can't do the same otherwise I wouldn't be teaching so the money making team currently has over 1.7 million assets under management that I am aware of that is only the mentorship that is not the YouTube or anything I have also heard about people getting funded just through my YouTube so I think that is the best measurement to actually judge me because if I teach them and they can do it then so can you so that leads me to the first point is of course having the right Mentor this is a big topic that we talked about in the previous video having the right mentor and sticking to that Mentor now again it might take a trial and error of going through multiple mentors and finding the one you actually like again we can't do everything right the first time maybe I'm not even the right Mentor for you that could be the case maybe you don't like the way I explained perfectly fine but it is very important to understand that you're not changing mentors because another Mentor has a shiny object that you like Etc that's not the case and again that leads me to the first thing I mentioned I believe the best way to judge a mentor is on how they teach and what their students have achieved stick to the same Mentor that is very important that's going to help you in the long run because your Mentor is there to guide are you through the process and to keep your mindset in check to keep you accountable Etc then the second thing I want you to understand it is not rocket science so I'm writing down rocket science but it is not rocket science there's not some kind of secret sauce to it there's not a secret blueprint to it it's a very straightforward simple blueprint and that is what we will go over of course here now the third step is of course a firm a prop firm or if you want to trade your personal account again perfectly fine you can trade your personal account if you don't really like prop firms Etc perfectly fine then this step would not be a firm for you it would be a broker for you so finding the right broker for example IC markets again if you're in America might be a little bit more difficult but there are also great options for that every firm I mentioned right here every broker I mentioned right here I don't have an affiliation with them I don't have an affiliate link I'm just giving you advice so I'll try not to mention a lot of problems as well so you can do your own due diligence with choosing the right problem it is of course important to know how you are trading what kind of Leverage do you need now I always look for preferably a problem with a 1 to 100 but there are problems out there that have a different calculation on contract sizes so in that case you need to be very aware and you need to talk with someone of that problem just so we know we can understand that we are able to risk the percentage that we want to risk then as well look for a prop firm with no consistency rule a consistency rule is basically you need to use the same amount of lot sizes over and over and over if that doesn't happen then they can remove you from the account spreads slippage stuff like that is also of course important what I always personally do and what I would always advise is if the prop firm has a Discord just hop in the Discord and search for slippage spreads Etc and you'll find a lot of information about it as well of course if you're a bit in communities Etc then you probably already know some prop firms that people recommend Etc and but I would always advise is just stick to the known ones so the best known ones they have a reputation to hold High most of the time of course so they will actually try their best to do something now again sometimes you can hear a story about a prop firm and I think every single problem out there has their own stories and usually people always like to share the negative Parts because of course we're all humans and for some reason we always tend to seek out every negative thing it's a habit that most of the humans have and the reason I mention all these things is as well because I don't want us to use the prop form as an excuse and what I mean by that and what a lot of people do is they tend to procrastinate the hard work the prop firm 99 of the time is not going to be responsible for your losing streaks for your drawdown for your Loan account Etc so it's also important for us to understand that we take responsibility when I blow the account whether the platform screwed me over or whatever I take full responsibility when we take responsibility for our own losses then of course we are also responsible for our own wins and that is important because then we have control over both sides we control our losses and we also control our wins we control whether we will make money Etc so we take responsibility always we don't use a prop form as an excuse and that also leads to the next thing where I would advise you to not get caught up in the whole platform story and be very active in discussions and arguments about all these things just choose a well-known platform and I know you can think of a well-known platform I just know it a lot of people they try to procrastinate their hard work that they need to do how do they do that they do it by complaining again or by constantly focusing on regulation this is that endless arguments endless discussions and if you need more than a couple of days to find the right platform for you then I truly think you are procrastinating because you're finding every reason on why you should avoid that hard work for example sometimes I need to do some hard work and yes of course I sometimes look up to it as in I don't want to do it I would rather sit on the couch eat some chocolate look at my phone and I know when I am looking at my phone I can I can catch myself in the act because I know I'm not on my phone because I should do something on my phone I'm on my phone because I'm procrastinating the hard work I'm procrastinating the pain now the pain is of course an exaggeration but before you actually start trading a lot of people try to procrastinate the Pain by back testing by choosing a prop firm for weeks and weeks just do it the person that just has the guts to do it is the one that will will always win in the end of the day whether he has more knowledge than the other person doesn't matter it's funny because the people with the most knowledge in this industry don't actually succeed because the person with less knowledge just does it he or she takes the action and he or she will always win from the person that is always trying to avoid actually doing it you can learn a lot about swimming you can learn all the ins and outs but the person that just jumps into the water and almost drowns themselves but then learns from it that is the person who will be a better swimmer at the end of the day you can learn as much as you want about swimming but at the end of the day you need to jump into the water sooner or later so that is also you feel until you win because you will fill and you will blow an account and you will not pass a challenge you don't need to why is it this expectation that everything needs to be so easy that we need to pass everything in the first time and I think I can have an ID because it's always been told at us that if we fail we're not good enough we don't pass something we don't make it whereas in this case in trading in business in general if you feel good very good because you fail until you win you need to keep on failing now of course does that mean going into a challenge and just already with the mindset I am going to use 10 risk and I'm going to blow the account again then I'm going to do it again no you need to fill but you need to learn from those experiences so usually people don't mess up because their trading plan doesn't work again everyone can understand the technicals but people can't stick to their psychology and their risk management so risk management is extremely important that's the next step if you have the right risk management approach then there is no reason to fill literally zero unless something strange happens with the prop firm Etc there's no reason to fill but people when they go into drawdown they get scared and they up their risk eventually instead of lowering their risk you always want to lower your risk so you want to have risk parameters you want to know when am I dropping my risk to zero to five percent when am I dropping my risk even to 0.25 percent and yes getting out of drawdown is an extremely boring process it is but unless you have millions to spend on challenges which I think most of us don't then you want to apply proper risk management your risk management goes hand in hand with your psychology because why most people fail is because they can't stick to their risk management because they can't stick to their psychology they can't keep their psychology in check when you are starting to tilt so you start to Revenge straight over to it you start upping your risk you also mess up your risk management so risk management is a hand in hand with your psychology you are already 50 50 on whether the market will go up or down everything we've talked about in the HZ guide has only enhanced that 50 chance if you just aim for a one to two RR with around even a 50 40 win rate within the beginning you will likely not have a high win rate because you're getting used to a strategy so take your time using that strategy don't expect a strategy to have a 80 win rate right off the bat it took me years to get to that stage so 50 win rate one to two RR you can't fill you can't fill the only way you will fill is through your psychology or your risk management again if you don't have your trading plan set in stone then of course we can blame our psychology all we want but if we don't know where we want to enter when we want to enter then it's futile to blame psychology because that's not how it works but once we have our trading plan we know when and where to end enter Then you can only fill through your psychology or your risk management and again risk management psychology same thing there is no secret to it the biggest secret I would say is risk management and psychology again that's why sat is not rocket science so then again you feel and you feel and you feel and then you win all of a sudden and you start winning hey you're getting used to the strategy you see your intuition is slowly taking over you're seeing the result of sticking to something of submitting to time that is a beautiful feeling every challenge you feel you will notice that the next challenge you take you think oh I'm getting better at this I am getting better and it's not better as in and with improving and learning for from our failures I don't mean you feel and you take a loss and now you look to incorporate A New Concept a new shiny object no you stick to the same things but you just look at it and see all right I could have maybe done this I could have maybe done that but you don't let A New Concept come into your Trading plan that is not what you want to do you want to stick to the same thing fill fill fill win and you might feel 10 times before you win who cares the process is the most fun now again you might go from Step 6 to 10 immediately and you might not fail in between what happens then is that you will win very easily on the first funded account if you're not prepared and your mindset is not ready then you will blow that account and you will blow the next challenges why does that happen because then all of a sudden you're overconfident you're used to winning and you never experience the pain of drawdown and having to climb out of drawdown slowly that is something you need to experience it you need to experience it before you win or even scarier like I just mentioned if you win before you fail then just know that field that is likely coming it's coming your way so be prepared be prepared for the drawdown Etc and again this is also taking responsibility and know how trading Works trading doesn't work work because I tell you my strategy and you use my exact strategy and all of a sudden you're now profitable it's not how it works if it was that easy everyone would be profitable and again that leads me to the whole point it's not about the technicals if it was about the technicals we would all be millionaires right here but very few people know what it actually takes to be profitable which is failing failing failing failing winning then when you win it is again not being overly happy of course you can be proud of course be proud of yourself take a look back at all the challenges you've filled how far you've come be proud but keep the focus because this is only the beginning so when you win again you don't need to get a payout of 10 15 no a two percent payout is fine it's perfect just get that payout and that refund from the fee that you paid for that challenge and that is fine and then now you have a profitable business because you need to treat it like a business you start maybe with a small funded account whatever you can afford again not Financial advice or anything but you start with a small funded account with a business and if you're in the business space you can compare that to trading because in business it is not advised to pump a lot of money and invest upfront a lot of money if you don't even know there's a market for it if you don't even know if you're going to be profitable if you don't even know if there is revenue coming in so why would you do that with trading why would you spend thousands of dollars on challenges if you don't even know you're profitable yet if you don't even know you can actually pass the challenges Etc so the way you start a small business is by making the business generate cash flow itself and from that cash flow that you make in the business now you can up the risk and you can buy more Etc when you see that the business itself you are already profitable so if you want you can grow that business just by maybe what is it a fifty dollar investment you can get a funded account from that two percent payout and the refund you buy another one and then you repeat the process over and over and over now that will take a lot of time but again what else are you going to do what else is there to do just enjoy the process believe me I've been there the outcome isn't really not that interesting yes of course it's nice and I'm not complaining at all don't get me wrong but when I achieved it I felt empty inside to be honest I felt very empty because I tied my happiness to that goal I was like if I reach that I will be happy I will have everything I want in life and it was the furthest thing from the truth so now I know and I can truly say that I am enjoying the process every day I'm enjoying the process of whatever my goal is I'm enjoying it doesn't matter how long it takes I'm not rushing it I don't care how long it takes I just know I will get there every goal I have I know I will get there 100 and if anything I look at it on the long term I don't think oh I want to be eat this this in the next month I need to reach this in even a year a year is a very small time period it's not long take your time enjoy the process so what did we talk about business right treat it like a business a two percent payout is fine don't blow your account because you're trying to reach 10 Etc take it slow Rome wasn't built in a day always remember that and then again time submit to time and enjoy the process it is truly fun it's really fun to process if you know the right steps of course because if you're in this endless cycle then yes it's not really fun but if you take these steps then yeah it truly is fun and then the last step is never never SOS and what do I mean by that never fall into the Trap shiny object syndrome never if you do that I can guarantee you you will never be funded you will never achieve the things you want to and that is with everything in life and again that's not me trying to be rude but that's just a reality of things because I am talking from experience right there never fall into the shiny object syndrome cycle and these are the steps these are the steps this is how the money making team has reached 1.7 mil Plus in assets under management now of course I'm saying it like you just do it and why are you not achieving it of course it's difficult it is difficult and especially in this industry because you don't really know who you can trust is my mentor teaching the right things is he throwing New Concepts at me every week because he's just hooking me and again if you're not sure then I would always like to invite you to follow along with the other students and with the money making team that we have right here because you're in the right place and if you listen to my videos over and over and over you will have the blueprint you will have the mindset you need the only thing that is holding you back is time only time now again inside the mentorship as well we talk about a losing curve about the actual risk management about the psychology about a full fun of the approach but this right here this is all you need these steps is all you need this Friday we have a giveaway and the giveaway is not the typical funded account giveaway no it's something different so I would love to see you there and if not of course I'll see you on the Sunday weekly forecast perfect thank you [Music]
