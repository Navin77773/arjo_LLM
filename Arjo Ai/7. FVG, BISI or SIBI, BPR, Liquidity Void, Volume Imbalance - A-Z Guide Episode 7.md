all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video about fair value gaps so if you were attending the live stream this past Sunday we were touching a little bit on how fair value gaps are creating a narrative now obviously there is a little bit more advanced but that live stream is a great video to watch after this one mainly the beginning of that live stream is where we talk about perfect apps that are creating a narrative again I'm live streaming on YouTube right here every Sunday at 8 30a.m New York local time so put your alerts on or either join the telegram where I announce the live streams link to the telegram is in the description alright so without further Ado let's get right into it so as you can see right here we have a few steps to go over first one being fvg FEG fair value Gap second one busy slash civi busy buysite imbalance cell side inefficiency civi sell side imbalance beside inefficiency BPR balanced price range liquidity void and volume aim balance all right so the first one being a fairvalue Gap what actually is a fair value Gap it is an imbalance that leaves behind an inefficiency in the market the market moves efficient so to deliver fair value fair value Gap if we have an imbalance on the buy side that means we are having a cell site inefficiency to deliver fair value we need to rebalance that buy side imbalance and deliver sell side inefficiency so what does a fair value Gap look like a fair value Gap is fairly simple right here you have one candle right here you have the wick so keep that in mind the top of that Wickso this candle that top of that Wick right here then we have 1 volcano that is expending higher this is a bullish fair value Gap then right here we have another candle that closes once this candle closes and it leaves behind only a body of a candle without filling in with Wicks then this creates a fair value Gap so this right here this box is a fair value Gap the fair value Gap is located between two weeks and it's a three candle formation always so once this candle closed doesn't matter whether it's up candle a downcandle once that candle closes that third candle it creates a fair value Gap now of course right here if we take a look at this for example this isn't a fair value Gap yes we have a body but there is no space between the first Wick and the second Wick there is no body in between there's no Gap so if you move a little bit further what do we have here we have a new fair value Gap right that is a verified Gap then right here we also have a fair value Gap right here you can see a verified Gap gets rebalanced right here doesn't have tocome all the way to the top it can already sting into it and then just go lower it doesn't have to rebalance it fully so you can probably see how price is navigating towards these fair value gaps all the time so right here verify your Gap right here for if I get right here for five Gap right here right here price is constantly navigating towards those fair value gaps so price is constantly rebalancing it is rebalancing inefficient price action and again right there is no premise to how big a fair value Gap should be this is also averified Gap this is also a fair value Gap the smallest little verified I get right here is also for very good even smaller this is also a fair value Gap as a long as the Wicks have a little body between them so right here there's a little body and the Wicks aren't overlapping if this Wick was a little bit to the downside right like this for example and there was no space in between then this wouldn't be a fair value Gap but now this is a fair value Gap all right now if we move on to the second one a busy and a city a busy buy sideimbalance so there's a imbalance on the buy side what does that mean this right here is an imbalance on the buy side and imbalance is the same as a fair value Gap and then a cell site in efficiency so there is no sell side delivery in that buy side imbalance or they go hand in hand when there is a bicep imbalance there is automatically cell side inefficiency so sell side needs to be delivered right there so right here buys that imbalance cell site inefficiency here cell site gets fulfilled so to make it even easiera busy is a bullish fair value Gap and you can make it easy right busy start with a B so buy so bullish fair value Gap CV starts with an S so sell so a bearish fair value Gap busy bullish forever Gap sebi bearish foreign sell side imbalance buy side inefficiency so for example right here cell site imbalance cell site verify your Gap a buy side inefficiency there is no price action on the buy side so right here that buy side inefficiency gets fulfilled then the next thing a BPR a balanced price range a BPR is toooverlapping fair value gaps so an overlapping busy with a civi what does that look like if we take a look right here this right here is a balanced price range and again all these five things essentially four because busy city is just a fair value Gap these can all be used as point of Interest or PD arrays that we can trade off of and a BPR is only the overlapping part of the two verify gaps so a bullish for Value Gap and a bearish for so if we take a look right here we have another one right here only the overlapping part is the part you wouldselect so for example right here it is a little bit overlapping so that is the only part you would select of course keeping in mind there's also a fair flag game right here there's also a BPR right here these are just a nice Confluence so that is a bprn overlapping busy and a city or an overlapping city with a busy now the fourth one is a liquidity void the difference between a fair value Gap and a liquidity void a fair value Gap there has been one-sided delivery meaning we have either a buy side imbalance or a cell site imbalancea liquidity void there was no buy side nor a sell side imbalance so there was no delivery of price action at all it is a gap in the market it is a liquidity void there was no price delivery at all so for example this is something you will see during news events heavy news events so I'm talking about US dollar fomc CPI NFP when these are high impact news events sometimes happen they leave behind a liquidity void on the lower time frame but if we take a look right here at the stocks stocks open up with a gap most of the time because there's noTrading right here the Mark is closed when they open up they are leaving behind a liquidity void so right here this part where there is no price action right here that is a liquidity void price has a very strong tendency even stronger than a fair value Gap what I would say so trade back into this liquidity void before continuing so right here just another example on the liquidity void this for example right here this little Gap in price action that is a liquidity void same for this little Gap those are liquidity voicethere was no price delivery on both sides of the market it just skipped a few price points a few price ticks this happens on Futures way more than on Forex pairs now for the last one the final one right here the fifth one a volume imbalance a volume imbalance is when there is a space between swing two candles so for example a candle should normally close right here and then open and they should be perfectly at the same price point right well this doesn't always happen and especially on future contracts so youwill see this less often in Forex more so on Futures like es which is the Futures contracts for the S P 500 and right here if we take a look and take a closer look this right here that is a volume in balance get right there there is a little bit of space between this close and this open of the candles so that right there would be a volume imbalance so if we take a look at the daily price action right here we have a few volume imbalances right you can see this one right there and we could see this one right there those are examples of volumeimbalances there is a little Gap right here between the bodies of the candles so this is a two candle formation and not a three candle formation now again all these things these five things basically four because BC and for Value Gap is the exact same thing these four things are the best when they are overlapping with another PD array that we have already touched on then they are the strongest and fair value gaps and liquidity voice and volume imbalances Etc they will tell you a story so if you are interested in that then you can takea look at the live stream especially in the beginning of the live stream that's where we touch on it alright I want to thank you study this and study how they form a narrative and I will see you at the next video on Friday alright thank you thank you [Music] foreign
