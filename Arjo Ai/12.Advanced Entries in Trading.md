all right no time for intros let's get straight into it you all know I hate riddles I hate people that talk in Mysteries and in riddles I think it's and I think we just need to get straight to the point so let's do that right here now our touch on the entries again in a more advanced manner but first off you need to understand that everything I'm talking about here is fractal so the plot the lot Etc can be applied to the Daily to get your drama quilty but a lot of people haven't thought of using that as your entry on the lower time frame so that can also be applied to the one minute time frame and then you have your entry and then you have your stop loss it's all a fractal thing the way you get to your entry pattern is the same way you get to your drone liquidity but once you have that drawn liquidity then the lower time frame is just to get in sync with price on the higher time frame that's all it is so if you have a slot on the higher time frame then you look for your external internal and then you have your flat on your lower time frame and that is exactly your entry and that is just to get in sync with the higher time frame there's a higher time frame here does the work for us so to make it even more advanced let's dive into this bit of price action we are on ES but again I'm not only trading es I trade Forex as well I trade indices I trade at your crypto I don't really trade Commodities but the same stuff applies to every single Market it is all the same so whether you are trading stocks Futures whatever you feel like everything I'm talking about works on that now once we get into the element of time so into the kill zones it is a little bit different but generally it's still the same but you will hear me mention it if something is or a specific Market so if we take a look at es right here we swept That Swing Low what is That Swing Low That Swing Low is a liquidity pool right the swing lows and swing Highs are how we can objectively look at liquidity pools now when we look at that liquidity pool and because we are trading with a liquidity Theory right when we are coming below that low and we are trading with liquidity Theory what should happen do you think institutions will be happy with price going below that low even further if institutions are truly buying below that low then do we not expect some sort of rejection that is the whole logic behind our Theory liquidity so if institutions are truly buying below that low then we should see some form of rejection ideally we should not stay below that low long and again that is a fractal concept that is for every single time frame if we have a turtle soup entry then we should not stay below or above a high very long and that's the same for inside a fair value Gap that's the same for inside a order block because these type of things the fair value Gap the order block to break a block the mitigation block it is all based around liquidity that's what you need to understand so when it is based around liquidity and we are looking and institutions are looking to buy at a new order block or take old orders off that is liquidity so we will not waste any time staying there so we want to see a rejection now how can we see a rejection now next part is where I want you to take notes because this is in a step-by-step manner but you need to take notes to actually develop that step-by-step Manner and to see it for yourself so if we dive into this price action right here we can already see some kind of rejection right here but the next thing is we are going in with the premise that institutions are not wasting any time below that low and they will want to buy immediately so if they are truly buying price will go higher almost instantly maybe a little consolidation but it won't waste any time below that low that's very important to understand that this is very key so if we drop into the 15 minute and take a look at this low right here we swipe this low and again what happens on the 15 minute right here that's irrelevant that it's not relevant to the left not relevant all that it was relevant was the daily swing low so right here we see what we are not wasting a lot of time price is rejecting a higher now how can we make this rejection somewhat objective well I'm glad you asked so right here we have that load this is your swing low right if institutions are buying what will we do we will come back Above That Swing Low how will we come back Above That Swing Low ideally with some form of displacement an energetic price move up how can we objectify displacement a fair value Gap that is your displacement so the only thing that you essentially need to be Scouting For here is a fair value Gap up that we have right there in that leg now it could have also happened in this leg but it didn't so in this leg that is more than enough we swept this low and yes there are some equal lows yes this looks like consolidation but again the higher time frame premise will not care about self-site liquidity if the higher time frame drawn liquidity is biased on liquidity the market doesn't give a about this consolidation when we are clearly aiming for buy side liquidity on the higher time frame so if we take a deeper look into this what did I just say I said all right if we are coming into a swing low in this case so a liquidity pool on the higher time frame and we are looking at a discount rate so there's a higher time frame this country then we want to have a sweep of That Swing Low of course but then we want to displace above it again so a move above it and a displacement those are two steps and I'll go into order block verify Gap as well don't worry but right here what do we see a move back Above That Swing Low so we could argue all right institutions might really be buying now we want to have another Confluence what is that next Confluence a displacement displacement is volatility in the market if institutions are truly buying and they really have big orders then they will 100 have some kind of volatility some kind of displacement so displacement how can we objectify it but you will hear a lot of times is just oh yeah it's just an energetic move just an energetic move come on what the is an energetic move what do you actually mean well let me objectify that for you because I had the same exact thing an energetic move is a fair value Gap that is how we can objectify the displacement so right here what do we see if we dive a little bit more deeper into it external remember what we talked about in the previous episode external and then what do we have next we break that high and what do we see we have external two here internal and this is also a swing failure this swing High failed to take out those swing lows right there swing filler with displacement in the leg higher all that is really relevant and the beauty of it you don't need to know a lot here all you need to see is that fair value get higher that is the thing I want you to understand now now inside the mentorship we have something called an st AKA sharp turn a beautiful Concept in my opinion that I use all the time to spot Market reversals Etc but the thing here that is important is that fair value Gap higher so these steps right we came below that swing low then we came back above it again and then we have a fair value Gap higher then we have displacement higher now I think a lot of people if you've watched the flot and the last video you will already know where to enter and place your stop loss because that's exactly what I talked about in the flood in the last video but let me go over it again what is your first line of defense that fair value Gap you could take the overlapping swing failure right there so what is your entry right there so what is your stop loss where your last line of defense that shouldn't get broken aha that's all it is now what is your target well what did I say inside the market structure video if we are moving from a daily discount what are we moving to next a daily premium so if we zoom out a little bit what is the next daily premium voila that is your next daily boom now of course the higher timeframe picture is still going higher so we could even aim for these Highs but just keeping in mind that the first daily premium is that daily fair value cap that is the first premium array that we are encountering so you want to manage your risk accordingly when you know that that is the first premium array that we are encountering because we can hold to the moon but again we need to understand that we are playing with probabilities here and this could have very well just gone lower off that premium rate so at least be Break Even or take some form of partials now again risk management is also something we will get into don't worry so if we drop back into the 15 minute right here and we target that fair value Gap that daily for that Gap that is a one two three now if you can catch a one two three on a consistent basis week in week out then I want to absolutely congratulate you because your future is absolutely no need to worry about it you are outperforming most headshots and that is absolutely insane you can make millions with just a one to three you can make millions with just a one to two with just a one to one if someone is telling you that you need to have 10 in a week and that you need to catch 20R trades don't believe that that is absolutely not necessary it might look fancy but again always come back to this question are you here to look fancy or to feel your ego or are you here to fill your pockets and take care of your family and make some money that is what we're here for so like I always mentioned we are not trying to flip 10K account to a million no we are trying to make 10K consistently on a million account that is what we're here for when you have the tool the money will come no worries about it of course not Financial advice alright now this was an example of a swing low now let's dive into another PD array so here we are on gu again a Forex pair but don't let that scare you because the same thing happens on Futures on ES on NASDAQ on the Dow or on stocks or Commodities wherever you want it to work so if we take a look at this chart what do we see we have that fair value Gap right there on the daily time frame we sting into that fair value Gap and then we continue lower so we are moving from what from a premium array to now what a discount array now whichever low is a lower right here this is your first discount rate so let's take a look for 50 or 50 up perfect equal lows alright so this is your first discount array AKA your target so in between this price action from this one to that one that is where you want to get involved now let's dive into the 15 minute again and let's Mark the lows of the fair fire gap which is this right here now you can probably tell we have liquidity here we have equal highs right there and even more equal highs right there now now I want you to ask a question are these eyes even relevant when we just took a look at the daily order highs on the 15 minutes right there relevant when we already had an established drone liquidity based off of the daily or is it all extra stuff and unnecessary but I have to give it to you it does look fancy the equal highs that are going swept and then it continues lower but is it relevant that's up to debate but in my opinion they are not relevant right here on the 15 minute so what do we see when we are coming into that fair value Gap same premise right same premise I want you to focus on the open of the ffi Gap right there that is the open the low of the fair value Gap we sweep above it and then we immediately reject lower so we are coming back below the fair value Gap low or the fair value Gap open we have an external here and even a small external here and what do we see next we have an internal right there now if we use the first line of defense and the last line of defense method again what would be the case here now we could say oh yes this was a perfect entry but that is not an objective way of looking at it because then I would ask you why did you not enter right here because this in first case and in real time this is your first line of defense overlapping with that breaker right there so something along the lines of that would have been your entry and then with the last line of defense this would have been your stop loss now I'm not trying to be dick or trying to be rude or anything but can you now see that your questions about stop loss about entry they were already answered inside the videos so what is the step-by-step process here well we came above the fair value Gap open then we came back below it and then what we had a fair variable lower AKA we had a displacement lower right there we used the plot of their entry and we used a lot as our stop-loss so this Spike up would have been scary at first but it is not an unlogical move why not well we don't have a fair value Gap in this lag lower so this High could get swept alright now what is our Target actually well we already established that way beforehand right there is your target beautiful absolutely beautiful right now let's say that you didn't want to take this entry just yet and you were waiting that's perfectly fine that is absolutely perfectly fine because if we take another look what do we have here we have an external move here then we have another what internal move right there that could have also been your entry now the stop loss gets a little bit bigger here because this is your stop loss right now and your target is right there still a one to two that is absolutely beautiful that is more than enough don't let other people fool you that you need a 1 to 10 RR on every trade that is absolute so if you were to wait a little bit longer then this would have also been an absolute beautiful entry now for you I want you to study this I want you to study the steps that we are taking and what I want you to do next is go over an example with an order block so use the order Block open as your rejection line so the same way we are using this line that we want to see a rejection lower again use the order Block open or a breaker Block open or any other PD array and see the rejection for yourself and the steps that you need to take for you to enter for you to place your stop-loss Etc now after watching this video are you ready to dive into the markets no you are not again study this but keep in mind you are not ready to dive into the market this is a great basic understanding of what we are doing here but you also need some form of experience etc etc if you want insights as well during the week using these Concepts as well then take a look at the link in description there's a link to my free telegram where I give insights during the week as well alright study this take care and thank you foreign
