the most dangerous conditions that you can get trapped in as a trending Trader are Seek and Destroy conditions now the name itself already tells you a lot right Seek and Destroy it's referring to constantly seeking liquidity taking people out of the market both sides of the market are getting taken out short Traders and a long Traders are both getting taken out in this episode I exactly want to go over how we can spot those conditions beforehand and then in the next episode I exactly want to go over Turtle soups and I want to go over how we can potentially capitalize on these conditions because as a Trader I believe you excel in either secant historic conditions or trending conditions it's not a one fits all type thing here we are on Australian dollar US dollar to show you my receipt that it actually is possible to spot Seek and Destroy conditions beforehand in the weekly forecast a heading into this condition the seek any short conditions this consolidation that you're seeing right there in the free weekly forecasts we already mentioned it and how we were able to spot it before it even happened was there are few conditions first off we took cell side liquidity so we took a major cell side liquidity right there the reason I say major cells are liquidity can you notice what this is this is already a big consolidation itself we take out the low of the consolidation right there that afterwards we immediately Target the opposing liquidity at the highest right there so we sweep the lows and then head for the highs in one big expansion higher right there in that moment what has happened we have taken both sides of the market price now needs to create and generate new liquidity in the market what then happens is if you draw your Fibonacci on that low and that high right there so just the range where the expansion happened the most recent range like a Magnus price will refer back to the 50 percent of that most recent range which is that that is equilibrium that is where price is in Balance it's not in premium it's not a discount it's at equilibrium and price will likely consolidate there now this is not guaranteed and the reason is not guaranteed it is guaranteed once PD arrays stop following through PD Rays not following through is the most important aspect to knowing when we have seek and historic conditions because taking the cells are liquidity taking the buy sell liquidity getting back to 50 of the range that's nice and all but to actually confirm so you can destroy conditions the last step before we actually can confirm seek and historic conditions that is when PD Rays stop following through what do I mean by that when we zoom in on this price action right there we have that fair value Gap that we are trading into and what is that for Value Gap doing right at that premium array is pushing price lower we have this fair value Gap right there what is that for valleycap doing that premium array again is pushing price lower then right there it is important first thing to note that we are at 50 so it's already getting tricky now the next thing is we have this fair value Gap and that order block sitting right there two premium arrays what happens right there we are not rejecting lower anymore can you see that and then we trade to the lows we don't take out the lows we immediately continue higher it is in Seek and Destroy conditions right there and why because the PD rays are not following through anymore the discount arrays are not following through the premium arrays are not following through and the beautiful thing you can notice on a daily time frame right there can you see all the Wicks there's no fair value Gap anywhere that is exactly what we would want to see or seek any store conditions or if you're a trend Trader of course you don't want to see this and you would love for it to never happen but unfortunately it will happen sooner or later you will experience these conditions alright here we are on the dollar and right here we again have seek and historic conditions there we take out a major liquidity pool what does price do like a magnet again it refers back to 50 percent of that most recent range and then to confirm the second short conditions what happens the PD rays are not following through any anymore so we have this sweep right there we have this fair value Gap that is not continuing lower no fair value gaps lower anymore no further gets higher either we just have Wiki price action and once you notice that the price is failing to follow through and you could have already noticed that very early on if you go back to an old old live stream I believe I managed it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday right there that I said alright we are in seeking short conditions and you need to be very careful and what I saw at that time so here we are zoomed in on the four hour what I saw at the time was if price wants to continue lower here then this fair value Gap should likely get respected and follow through right so once this happens we come into that fair value Gap right there and we failed to follow through and then we do come into an order block right there but there's no Friv going higher either right there PD rays are not following through so you want to either avoid it or this is your time to shine and this is exactly where you want to get involved now how can we know that the sick and historic conditions are over and that as Trend Traders we can finally trade again and that a sec and Destroy conditioned Traders we might want to get out of the market again when price displaces out of the range out of the consolidation that is exactly when we can look to trade it again what do I mean by that first off what is the consolidation the consolidation the major consolidation is this right here right it's this whole gray area that is your consolidation then the next part is what is displacement a displacement is a fair value Gap now you ideally want something on the higher time frame to create a fair value Gap not just a one minute fair value gap of course that that is not significant enough right there we have a fair value gap down but does it displays out of the consolidation no it does not so right there we have a new fair value Gap alright nice and here we have a new fair value Gap and it displaced out of the consolidation that is exactly when you can look to trade again and that is the first sign when seek and short conditions are over this usually happens during NFP CPI or fomc based on the news again that is when price has the volatility to push out of a consolidation to push out of the seek and short conditions now how can we confirm that price is truly out of the second short conditions again the first sign is of course that we are displacing out of the consolidation the second sign is PD arrays are finally following through so discount arrays are finally following through again and that is exactly when we have trending conditions again and then I'll see you at the next A to Z guide episode on Friday where we are going to go over how we can capitalize on Seek and Destroy conditions using Turtle soups but also going over Turtle soups that can be used in trending conditions so a full turtle soup lecture alright now if you want more on low probability conditions and high probability conditions I would highly advise to check out this video and then I'll see you at the next A to Z guide on Friday alright thank you thank you foreign
