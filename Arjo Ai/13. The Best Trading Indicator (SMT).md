all right so today I wanted to touch on smt smt stands for smart money technique a very powerful two and a very powerful indicator you could call it but there are a few specifics that we need to stick to and that we need to know before we can actually use this indicator now as well an important announcement masterclass enrollments are opening up again on the 17th of June masterclass is truly a beautiful step-by-step guide on putting all the concepts together and getting to a profitable consistent trading plan that fits your personality because that is very important and inside the master class you will also have access to my Discord where you can ask me questions and connect with like-minded Traders as well as you will eventually have the chance if you are ready for it to get linked with a capital provider that way you will have easier access to Capital to trade with and again if you want to be a part of this exclusive community then be aware of the fact that we work with a waiting list once the waiting list is full enrollments will close and just a reminder enrollments are not opening up again in July so be there first link in the description alright so smt smart money technique now smart money technique I think some of you may already know what it is others of you don't know what it is and a lot of people think they know what it is now the first thing we need to understand is that for smt you need to find or you need to have an instrument that you are trading and you need to find another instrument that is closely correlated to the instrument that you are trading so in this case we are trading the E mini SMP the e-mini SMP Futures Contract which other instruments are closely correlated to the es think of NASDAQ the NASDAQ futures contract NQ or ym the Dao fuses contract now for Forex it would look something like maybe Euro US dollar and then you pair it with GBP US dollar Forex is something we will get into as well don't worry so right here we have a four-hour fair value gap on e-mini SMP now if we dive into that for our fair value Gap now we can obviously already see in hindsight that it is moving higher now when we are coming into that for our profile Gap again things on the left right here are not that relevant only when we are looking at smt then the left becomes relevant because if we now take a look and click on a plus sign right there and we click on nqm the same exact Futures Contract just for the NASDAQ new price skill I like to double click on the line then go to line and change it to candles this way what this allows me to do is compare the swing lows so since es and NASDAQ should move perfectly in sync since they are so closely correlated sometimes you will see that they are not moving in sync so sometimes you will see either es or NASDAQ make a lower low moving lower than the NASDAQ does and that is exactly what we want to scout for so if we take a look right here and we Zoom a little bit in on this yard and on this yard and right here we are coming into the for our profile Gap and that right there that is when we want to scout for now smt if we are looking for bullish smt then we are comparing swing lows so right here what do we see we have a swing low made right here on ES we have a swing low on NASDAQ right there a very small swing low right there to the right of that is what another swing low this swing low is lower than that swing low so this is a lower low right here but if we take a look at es we had a swing low right here and this swing low is higher than the swing low to the left of it that is smt there is a crack in correlation they should move in sync and right here they are not moving in sync when that happens there's something underlying there's something behind the scenes there are orders being placed in the Market at that moment in time so right here we draw a line and we draw a line right there that is smt now it could have very well been the other way around right at es made a lower low and that NASDAQ made a higher low that is completely fine as long as they are not moving in sync the swing lows are not lining up perfectly they are not the same that is exactly what we want to see but if you're using smt for a bias too then you are using it the wrong way you will absolutely confuse the living out of yourself if you're using this as a bias tool smt is useful when it is one of your last indicators as in you've already come to your bias you already have a PD array that you now want to trade off you are now looking for confirmation and inside that confirmation there's smt that is perfect that is where we want to see smt when we are confirming some form of PD Ray that is where we want to see smt so if we look a bit further what do we see right here swing low the same swing low is right there on NASDAQ then what do we see here we have swing lows we have another swing low then we have another swing low right there this swing low again is lower than this swing low and this swing low on ES is again higher than this swing low what do we have again smt so again that is our Confluence that is a very strong Confluence that price might want to move higher and again because we already had the context we already had the higher time frame bullish bias then we want to compare the swing lows not the swing highs we are not looking at bearish smt we only focus and Scout for bullish smt here that is crucial to understand now another question is which instrument do you actually trade right here obviously if you are an es Trader or you normally trade NASDAQ then execute on Dapper perfect fine if you are a full-time es Trader and that is your pair that is your bread and butter then just execute on ES whether it makes a lower low or a higher low doesn't matter if you are more of a hybrid style so you want to choose one in the coming videos we will touch on which pair you would want to trade just based off of smt alone is not enough to look at which pair you want to execute on you want to find the strength leader on a higher time frame basis and that is the one you want to trade so in this case you would ask yourself which instrument has been moving a higher more easily over the past few weeks past few days Etc in this case if you take a look at the chart on your own it was NASDAQ so if we were to execute on NASDAQ instead of es right here then we can see the entries I can already tell right here the entries are a bit more difficult but how can we now enter off of this how can we enter when we do c smt I think the es entries when you take the last episode as example it is already pretty self-explanatory right we can all see the entries right here and right here that is what we went over on the last episode but right here this is known as as a turtle soup so when we see smt do we just place an order below that low and now place our stop loss right there and then torque the highs we could do that but at that moment in time we don't know for sure if it is smt so the best technique to enter is called buying on strength technique so what you would do here is the candle that is responsible for a sweep below that low which is this red candle right there that is the one responsible for coming below that low and in that moment if NASDAQ does want to move higher and come above this candles are high right there the candle that was responsible for coming back below that low that exactly there would be your entry now of course your stop-loss give it some room give it some room to breathe don't suffocate your stop loss and that is exactly exactly how you could capitalize on smt and how you could capitalize on a turtle soup in that case so right here if we are NASDAQ Traders as a standard and we wanted to execute on NASDAQ because it's also the stronger pair based off of the higher time frame then this is a technique that we could use to enter on NASDAQ so if we take a look at the other smt that we already had right here this one then what would we do we would do the exact same thing so this right here this candle is responsible for sweeping that low so place a buy stop above that candles are high now where do you place your stop loss right here no give it some room to breathe don't suffocate your stop loss so in this case what you could do is say all right give it six points give it six points so right there we have a six point stop loss perfectly fine keep in mind that this is basically calling the bottom right so once you wait and you allow yourself to have some sort of patience then the better entries will come because you can refine your stop loss better these turtle soup entries Etc are not always the best entries because you need to take into account your stop loss that you were basically calling a top or a bottom but if you do like this and this is exactly how you could capitalize on it so let's dive into an example on Forex pairs as well alright so here we are on GBP USD AKA cable or gu what do we see here based off of the daily well we have this daily fair value Gap sitting right there overlapping with what right here an order block this is our last line of defense this could be our Target so right here we are again looking for some sort of confirmation of that daily fair value Gap let's see if we can get some form of smt which other pair would we use for smt in this case what I would go with is EU so Euro US dollar you can also use the dollar itself especially if you're trading Euro US dollar you can use the dollar but what I like to do is just use Euro US dollar and Great British pound US dollar makes it a little bit easier but again if you prefer just to use the dollar aka the dxy then that is perfectly fine I'm just showing you what's possible here and again if you don't want to use smt that is also very important to understand if you don't want to use smt then just don't use it you are not forced to use smt in this A to Z guide I'm showing you options and that is what we talked about in the intro as well I'm showing you optional things to get to a trading plan to get to an entry pattern Etc and if you don't want to use certain Concepts that I'm teaching here that is perfectly fine do whatever you are comfortable with do whatever feels good for you alright right here we are looking at gu so I'm going to take Euro US dollar as my other pair so new price kill right here I double click on it and then I go to the candles you can as well you can use the line but just keep in mind that when you are using the line this takes the bodies of the candles and this doesn't actually take the Wicks which then indicates obviously that we are not actually looking at swing highs and swing lows based off of the line chart again if you want to use the line chart that is perfectly fine but what I do is I use the candles just so I can get a clearer look at what the swing lows and swing Highs are you can probably already tell there is a huge smt right here compare this low right there and this low to this low and that low can we see what is happening here this right here on you is what it is a swing failure this on gu is what it is a breaker pattern just like we saw on NASDAQ and Es just a couple minutes ago yes was making a swing failure pattern and NASDAQ was making a breaker pattern now if we pay a little bit more attention what do we see as well we have this swing low which is that swing low on gu which obviously gets taken out right there so again a breaker pattern and here we have a swing filler it is failing to come below this swing low again smt compare the swing lows right there that is double smt right there beautiful a very strong Confluence a very strong indicator that we might be going higher now you can already tell this wasn't my indicator to get to my bias no this was my indicator to get to my entry and to have another Confluence because we are working with probabilities and when there is smt it is a higher probability that the entry will work out that is important to understand but I already had context of the higher time frame so right here again this is something we will get into into the next videos as well which pair would you buy the one that is making the swing forward pattern or the one that is making the break better now sometimes you will hear people say you buy the one that is having manipulation so in this case it would be due or you buy the one that is making the swing filter because it is stronger and I somewhat agree with that as well but what I like to stick to is I buy the pair or the instrument that is stronger based off of the higher time frame and that is something we will get into and you can probably tell right now on you that the entry technique that we use on NASDAQ the buying on strength technique is a little bit more difficult here because it just keeps on moving down so you would have your buy stop right here first and then right here no fills just yet and then eventually you get your entry pattern that we talked about in the last episode and that is where you can potentially capitalize on so this is smt again last reminder most gloss enrollments are opening up on the 17th of June we go way more in depth inside the mouse class it is truly the A to Z guide on crack if you want to be a part of that then be fast because they are not opening up again in July so what I want you to do is I want you to study bearish examples I gave you bullish examples now I would love for you to study bearish examples so you compare the swing highs first get to your drawing Equity first get to your buys and then when you're looking for your entry pattern then you compare the swing highs Etc alright perfect I want to thank you and I'll see you at the next video on Friday thank you thank you [Music]
