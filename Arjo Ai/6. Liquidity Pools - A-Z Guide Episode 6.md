hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this video we are going to be touching on liquidity pools a very interesting topic and this is very important for you to understand because this is the basics of why our strategy works and how the market operates again just a little reminder if you have watched one ICT series and Romans for my master class are opening up tomorrow very limited spots so I mentioned in the beginning that the A to Z guide is for advanced Traders as well and if you don't think that the A2Zguide is for advanced Traders you are absolutely wrong and I don't mean that in a rude way but this A to Z guide is just as much for advanced Traders as it is for beginner Traders because if you watch these videos multiple times you will find certain golden nuggets that most likely only Advanced Traders will pick up on so if you're a beginner that's great watch the videos but maybe watch it a couple times and when you are further on your journey to becoming a profitable Trader maybe watch the videosagain and then you'll pick up on new things alright now let's get into it right here so liquidity pools what are liquidity pools well above highs what are above a highs above highs there are breakout trailers that are trying to buy price above ice breakout Traders so when price breaks out above a high they are trying to buy it with a buy stop but there are also stop losses of people that are short in the market both the stop losses and the breakout trailers use buy stops so above price above market price so for example Mark Priceis here above it are buy stops and below it are sell stops so if we we know that that makes up liquidity and now we need to find out how does the majority of the market trade the majority of the market the majority of Traders never gets past the simple patterns right they never get past the support and resistance the trend lines The Head and Shoulders patterns again there's nothing wrong with it because people are profitable with these patterns but I'm just trying to tell you majority of the people majority of the Traders trade like thatand they are most of the time referred to as retail Traders now a retail Trader we are also retail Traders obviously but retail Concepts or some people call them I don't like to call them that but they call them dumb money Concepts but again that's something we can touch on later on now if there needs to be a buyer for every seller and there needs to be a seller for every buyer who is actually providing that liquidity well if we know majority of the people have sell stops right here below Lowe's thencentral banks big institutions Etc their orders will get filled below these lows because their orders are so big they need some sort of liquidity to get into the market so for all the sell stops there will be buyers on the other side so right here once we do this and we come below a low below a consolidation or whatever I'll give you some real chart examples just in a few moments right here institutions central banks are buying those orders and obviously the sell-stop Traders right here the stop losses or the breakoutTraders are now trapped so now if we want to take profits on those buys because central banks institutions Etc they have just bought then who can we actually sell to well we need someone that is willing to buy our positions so we need liquidity again where is the liquidity above the highs we now need buy stops and above these highs is exactly where central bank's institutions are willing to take profit so they are willing to sell to buyers who is the buyer here well above a height you'll typically see breakoutTraders but also you'll see stop classes of people that were short in the market so both of those positions are buy stops so we are selling to buy stops so right here we are able to take profit not we the central banks and institutions are able to take profit now of course you need to understand central banks and institutions are not aiming for your liquidity they are not aiming for your two lots that you put into the market absolutely not they are aiming for huge funds for example you will hear the nameTurtle soups what is a turtle soup how was turtle soup invented do you recall and maybe Google it there is a book The Turtle Traders those Traders are called Turtle Traders and they mainly follow the trend so huge funds Etc they mainly follow Trends they are Trend followers when the trend changes they are hurting they are bleeding but when the trend continues Etc they are mainly correct in their analysis those huge funds that are turtle Traders so they follow a trend like this what does this make a liquidity sweep AKA a turtle soup thatis where the name turtle soup comes from so a turtle soup is a sweep of the turtle Traders alright now this is the basics the absolute Basics and the Necessities that you need to understand liquidity and to understand these liquidity pools because obviously we can trade this but we need some sort of logic behind it because also that will Comfort us when we have some sort of logic behind stuff our rational mind likes it more that's why a lot of people are here in the first place that's why a lot of people are trading SMC in thefirst place because we need some sort of logical explaining for everything and that is also detrimental let me tell you that is not always a good thing especially not in trading and again like I said right when you are placing a trade into the market so you are trading on your broker and and you're placing your two lots into the market you're buying with two lots you are not actually being targeted by by the central banks or buy the liquidity or Hunters we can call them no and we don't actually need a lot of oppositeliquidity to get out of the market as well or to buy or to sell because we are very small we are very very very small but again that's something we'll dive into deeper later on so let's dive into some real chart examples and how can we actually use this to our advantage alright so if we take a look right here what do we see well we see some sort of resistance right here right we have if we are now thinking as retail Traders or retail concept Trader so support and resistance and trend line Traders mainlythen right here we have resistance and we have some sort of support at the bottom right here so this should hold a support this support is now resistance right here so what is below this below this line there are cell stops those sell stops we or central banks and institutions can buy those sell stops right here they are getting bought where is now the opposite liquidity the opposite liquidity is above these highs buy stops so if we want to profit off of these buys right here well we will Target opposite liquidity we have bought we arewilling to sell above these highs we are willing to sell so we have a seller now we need a buyer who is willing to buy buy stops above debt resistance again that is people that were short here or even short right here when this turned into resistance with your stop loss right here above this resistance that stop loss is a buy stop and willing breakout Traders so then right here again what are we targeting even further well we have a relatively equal highs right here this is also resistance or support and resistance Traders so againtheir stop loss might be above it and we have breakout Traders above it there is liquidity above it then right here if we take a look at this we have some sort of trendline liquidity here right trendline liquidity and what do we have right here we have a high a above a high what's above a high there is liquidity so here above a high we are tricking in buy stops those buy stops who is willing to sell we are we are willing to sell or those buy stops and then now we are in a short position what do we need next if we areshort and we are going lower we want to because that's the mechanics how it works we want to buy at a lower price eventually alright so what is this this right here is support what is below it sell stops so we can pair ourselves with cell stops so we are able to take profit again this might be a little bit overwhelming so re-watch it a couple times and once you do dive into the charts on your own then this will make more sense and then you can see what are we now targeting this trendline liquidity there are willingbuyers at the trendline liquidity so we take that trendline liquidity out all the stop losses are right here beneath those lows that's where liquidity is and that's where we target all right now this is all all right now this is all fun but how can we actually apply this to our trading so let's take a look at how we can actually use this in our trading all right so if we take a look again at this example that we've used before on docs right here we had this monthly order block right here then ifwe drop down into the four hour we had this breaker right here what do we have here we have relatively equal lows they get the webs before we have the real move now when we retrace into the breaker what are we leaving behind we have relatively equal highs right here and we have relatively equal highs right here those can be used as Target or our traits and as extra confluences because in trading we are stacking up confluences all the time then if we drop down into the five minutes in that four hour breaker what do we actually seebefore we tap into the four hour breaker we take liquidity then the next thing we are doing we have right here we have equal highs we are taking them then right here what do what is above Price Right Here equal highs relatively equal highs where do we target right there relatively equal highs get taken now I want you to understand this is very important because this is a mistake I've made in the past as well just because there is equal highs just because there is trendline liquidity doesn't mean price has to go there immediately thatis the wrong mindset just because we have equal lows right here doesn't mean price has to now trade back into it so for example right here we had this liquidity right this is the consolidation eye right here we have a lot of consolidation that are willing breakout Traders above consolidations and below consolidations so price will very often take one side of the consolidation first and then Target the opposite side of the consolidation now if we take one side of the consolidation doesn't mean we can instantly Target the opposite side no weneed a reaction first we need some sort of sign that price is telling us yes we want to Target the opposite side and it is very important to understand that this is done on the higher time frame so if you're only trading liquidity pools on the lower time frame you will confuse the absolute out of yourself so right here we are taking the highs of the consolidation right breakout Traders are trapped stop losses are taken we are in a short position now if central banks and institutions are truly selling above those highs thenthey will not stay above those highs very long so we will see displacement to the downside and that is very important and the same goes or if we are taking liquidity so for example this low if we are taking liquidity below that low and institutions and central banks they are yes they want to get involved and obviously price will not stay below that low very long because their orders are so big so price will instantly move these orders these cell stops will instantly get bought boom just like that so we need to have some sort ofrejection right here we have a rejection and then we can Target the opposite side and that is very important to understand and a lot of people do not pay attention to that and they are just they think a highest getting taken and they are just shorting right here price is going higher and they are still short short and they are just taking loss after loss after loss after loss right here and another loss and price is just going higher it isn't even showing signs of weakness and it's just going higher andpeople are just taking losses after loss after loss after loss and that's not the right way to approach this we need to have a logic behind what we're doing and if institutions are truly selling above highs then price will not stay long above those highs and again you need to understand right I'm making sort of a story right here so I just told you that just because there's liquidity on the opposite side doesn't mean we are going to targeted immediately and then I just told you that if we are truly sellingabove highs and buying below loathe we need some sort of reaction they are in harmony with each other because when we get that reaction we can truly Target opposite side and then we can truly Target opposing liquidity as in we can truly Target this trendline liquidity now because we have seen a reaction away when we swept a low very important to understand always react always React to what price is doing alright now the last thing I want you to understand is a liquidity sweep is different than a liquidity run a run on liquidity is whenwe will continue lower so for example if we take a look right here above this High we just saw a sweep The Sweep is when we sweep liquidity right here above the highs and Target opposing liquidity now a run on liquidity is when we keep running so we don't sweep we just keep going lower so right here we have liquidity on the lows So Below the lows are liquidity we keep running we are not sweeping we are running the liquidity right there so it's going down and it's going to keep going down when we are running liquidityall right you are going to need to watch this video multiple times to understand it and you are going to need to absolutely do the work on your own as well so after this video study equal highs equal lows trendline liquidity study head and shoulder pattern so look up the patterns and see how price is absolutely being manipulated and see how we are moving from one liquidity pool to the next liquidity pool and in between those liquidity pools what do we see a breaker we see thumb form of PD erase that we went over we see them holdingright here until we take out the posing liquidity pool so again do the work and you will understand it a hundred percent completely no worries it just takes time again a reminder if you are a bit more advanced already than the enrollments or my mouse gloss are open right now so check that out if you are interested and I'll see you at the live stream on Sunday and if not then I'll see you on Tuesday at the next video on the A2Z guide alright thank you foreign foreign [Music]
