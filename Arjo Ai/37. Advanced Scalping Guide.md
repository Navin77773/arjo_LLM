the trading industry has been lying to you about a lot of things including sculpting now in this video I need you to understand I'm going to keep it very real and I'll try my best to expose all the lies and of course I will also show you how to do it instead I also need you to understand that I'm talking from experience here I've seen it all I've done it all before I want you to learn from my experience so you don't have to make the same mistakes that I did this will be a full scalping guide now first off I want to go over what not to do and then afterwards I want to go over what you should be doing both parts are really important now the way people approach sculpting nowadays they go into the market and they just let them guide by their intuition so they're fully in their emotions and they go into the one minute and they say all right we have one fair value lower right there with small forever low right there so that should eventually go lower as well right and it takes stop loss after stop loss after stop loss after stop loss because they don't understand how to scope yes you are indeed scalping when you take a trade off of one of these verified gaps right here because you're getting in quick and you're getting out quick but if you're just taking trade by diving into the one minute and taking a trade off of every one minute pair of value Gap and you're letting the one minute guide you then ask yourself is that truly beneficial for you are you truly benefiting off of that and be honest with yourself because I don't think you are a lot of people are sculpting because they think scalping is more traits equals more money the people that make the most money in this industry they don't sculpt they let the capital do the heavy lifting for them now again I'm not trying to discourage you because if you truly like scoping and you're very good at it perfect do it but usually people are sculpting for the wrong reasons nowadays it's a trend to scalp and humans are just Trend followers and I don't mean Trend followers is in the mark is going higher or lower no they follow the trend as in this human is doing that so I guess I will also do that they just follow the masses let me tell you the masses are extremely unsuccessful most of them so what this whole Channel what this whole YouTube channel is also about we are not trying to do the same things that other people are doing because clearly that isn't working we are focused on making money very important again why do people usually sculpt because they think you work harder because you have more opportunities potentially if you're using the one minute then of course there's going to be opportunities everywhere and then they think because you have more opportunity so you must make more money right let me tell you working harder in trading does not equate to making more money it's the opposite World in trading less is more in trading that's just a general rule of thumb to go by when you're doing something always remember less is more in trading especially in trading in trading you need to understand you will not get reward wired by someone that is higher up than you that will tell you why you worked so hard today maybe you lost a lot of money but you worked really hard great job no you need to understand here it's less is more so working harder in trading does not equate to making more money and again with working harder I'm aiming at trying to find the most opportunities during one single trading day that is absolutely detrimental then I also need you to understand that sculpting is very fancy or all the reasons I just stated it's very quick action it's like you can compare to tick tock and YouTube YouTube You'll likely learn the most but it's not the most fancy right tick tock where you have a five second video you'll likely not learn that much but it is very fancy so again if you want to be a scalper you need to be a scalper for the right reasons that is very important if your scalper just mainly because everyone does it or the bigger reason and people think sculpting makes the most money which is absolutely the furthest thing from the the truth it's garbage it's not true and usually that is why people get into sculpting now it's funny because I have a sculpting guide here and I'm absolutely annihilating sculpting here but I need you to understand that the reasons you are sculpting need to be absolutely correct because a lot of people are just going into the one minute time frame and they take every one minute fair value Gap without any reason behind it and it tried to argue with the point yeah but I don't need a daily bias do you really not need daily bias again if you're trying to follow some algorithm and you know the algorithm is mainly controlled by orders on the higher time frame so that has four hour daily weekly and monthly then who are you really fooling you're fooling yourself by saying that you don't need a daily bias because you do and if you truly are convinced that you don't need a daily bias then I would ask yourself are you truly benefiting off of the fact that you're not using a daily bias or are you just being lazy and you don't want to put in the work because most of the time it's the latter where people are just lazy and they don't want to put in the work because it's too difficult you yes of course it's difficult you thought it was going to be easy you start being rich and having freedom in this world was going to be easy of course not that's what makes it fun the reward is so fun because it takes effort death feeling is so fulfilling so that is very important to understand then how can we sculpt first off we need to understand some kind of daily bias now the daily bias I'm going to be using as you may have already seen is the exact same one in the previous video so in the previous video we went over daily bias if you've not seen that just yet finish this video and afterwards watch that daily bias video it's the previous A to Z guide episode where we mentioned alright this fair value Gap is not strong right it's not a strong Verger right there then this fair value Gap is likely a strong perfect Gap because if this is not pushing price higher the FFL Gap then what will push price lower this premium rate in form of Death Valley Gap in between those fair value gaps all you're doing is your finding the high probability price action so you're looking at the stronger fair value gaps which fair value is stronger here this fair value Gap is weaker than that for Vega so this is the stronger fair value right what you're doing between this fair value Gap and that next Target right there you're letting the one hour guide you the one hour is your guide to your next Target so constantly you're letting the one hour guide in that one hour price action is what I will show you you're taking either one minute entries or five minute entries now to show you why you still need context and why you still need to be able to read price action on the higher time frame if we dive into this piece of price action right there on the one hour so here we are here we have the weak daily forever Gap and we have the strong daily for five Gap sitting right there as well then this price action what you would be doing you would be looking at structure based on the one hour so now you would be using time to your advantage and ideally as well news but there is an extract Confluence the video we talked about how you can use the news drivers to know which they will expand Etc that is an extra Confluence so time into a PD array and there you look for your confirmation now if we have a weak fair value Gap and we don't have clear context right there because this is a weak fair value Gap they're not really bullish we're not really bearish then what is happening we take this order block when we dive into the one minute what will you see you'll see here that when coming into that discount rate that order block on the one hour that we will take a lot of losses right there why because the context is not supporting the ID that is why when you're just taking random one minute verify gaps everywhere that will not be sustainable on the long term why not let me tell you if we zoom out back onto the one hour time frame what will we see we will see that high probability price action for example when coming off of this strong daily feather Gap right there this pushes price lower in a very short amount of time in what is it one day and 16 hours this verify Gap right there did what it took about five days and 18 hours to push price higher low probability conditions will last way longer than high probability conditions so for sculpting it is very important to also identify the high probability conditions especially when you're on the lower time frame like the one minute because on the one minute you can extremely easily blow an account because there's always a reason to justify a trade ID on the one minute the entries will all look the same what is difference between one one minute for Value Gap and the other one minute fair value Gap it's what happened before that it's the boundary that needs to get hit first and then we have the one-man February Gap that is where you want to enter so let me show you what I mean with that if we have no boundary like I just mentioned and we go into the one minute time frame then we can take every one minute fare value Gap as an entry does that mean it's a good entry absolutely not what is the boundary that happens before that that is what differentiates a week one minute traffic from a strong one minute there needs to be a boundary before that the boundary is a one hour PD array or a 15 minute PD array again when coming off of ideally a daily fair value Gap or a daily PD array so first off you need to have the daily somewhat agreeing to your idea to go into the one hour because what we just saw is that if we have the one hour agreeing right here but we don't have the daily agreeing so right here we have the one hour agreeing going higher but we don't really have the daily agreeing not really a strong for Vega then we will take a lot of hit before we get the right move and that is very dangerous in sculpting because in sculpting like in the industry they show you all the wins but if we took every one minute verify Gap that was sitting right here we would have taken 10 hits before we get a win and that one win yes we can brag about it on Instagram on Twitter whatever and that's usually what people to do but they don't tell you or they forget to tell you quote unquote forget about the 10 losses that they took because they were identical when you have one minutes verify gaps that are identical which one are you taking you need somewhat of a guideline right there and the guideline is whatever happens before that so A one hour PD Ray in context of your daily bias again remember the daily bias respecting and disrespecting Etc we established on a daily time frame here a week for flag up strong fair value Gap respect because we are wicking next Target could be that daily discount array in the form of that swing low right there so that is our context in between that high and that low right there that is where we want to get involved ideally because we have high probability price action right there then if we go into the one hour we need the one hour to show fair value gaps lower to agree with the ID of going lower indeed right here this is the next day we have a new fair value Gap so first we respected that for Vi Gap based on the daily time frame now we have a new day right there showing a new bearish fair value Gap inside that provide Gap that is your one hour PD Ray that you will use to go into the one minute to now scalp now the reason I say you can also use the five minutes usually what people think is going into the one minute means that you are sculpting or going into the second time frame Etc what if I tell you you can make it easier for yourself and the five minute you can achieve the exact same entry as you would have taken on the one minute maybe even a better entry but the five minute usually isn't fancy enough for people the five minute you can achieve the exact same entries and it would still be scoping let me show you what I mean with that if we dive into the one minute on that one hour fare value Gap right there then once we are here what do you want to do you want to wait for your St and then you want to wait for your new February leg up lower which once we have an SD right here then we have a new verify Gap lower right there as well that is where you can place your entry on the overlapping part with those lows there as well and you cover what do you cover the intermediate term high that is right there what do you target well since you are sculpting you have a close Target you get in you get out so ideally at first a one to two a one to two is perfectly fine to Target at first so somewhere around they're perfectly fine and again you don't need to do this right because you could have also very well done a real scalp where you now enter off of this overlapping part because that is also already valid you cover the fair value Gap and you charge a one two two a one to one right there a real short gulp as long as you have that context and it's not a random one minutes fair value Gap or one minute or the block right there you need to have account text of the time frames above it otherwise you will get burned but let me show you something even more beautiful if we go into the five minute on the exact same piece of price actually so again this is the one hour five Valley Gap and we just use a five minute St then right there would have been the exact same entry but even better and then right there you have your one to two already you can't convince me that that is not sculpting because this reached your take profit you get tacked in and in the next candle it reaches your take profit that is the same as sculpting and I would argue even better it has higher probability not taking random fair value gaps Etc again you can see that when I talk about my plan everything that I do is fully fractal I mean that because this in the previous episode was also just a one hour entry and based on the last R trading plan it was also just a one hour entry this could have been a swing trading plan entry could have been a scalp could have been a day trade so whatever you want it to be then after a one hour PD rate has been reached then then we can go potentially into the 15 minute because then the 15 minute is also leaving behind something most likely and right there on that 15 minutes fair value Gap overlapping with that order block what do we have we have a new PD Ray to work with AKA we have a new boundary a new reason to go into the lower time frame to sculpt so when we go into the one minute based off of that 15 minute verify Gap you'll see that right here you don't need a lot of confirmation to work with because 15 minute and one minute they are closer to each other when you're using a one hour PD Ray you would need more confirmation based of your one minute time frame you have a bigger PD array so you have more candles to work with the lower the time frame 15 minute PD Ray one minute St is enough so right here that could be your entry it's medium term High Target or one to two right there and again how long did it take you from that candle to that candle 17 minutes is that not sculpting again are you in the edit right here and that trade took you 17 minutes to hit check profit but it took you a couple of days to wait for that trade to happen and to play out waiting for that high probability conditions that is where scalpers will mess up and every Trader in general will mess up because an unfruitful price action for example this waiting for that high probability scope right there that is where they will already blow the profits already being drawdown already below the account and that is exactly what I'm trying to tell you that sculpting does not mean that at any time of the day you go into the one minute time frame to take a trade the 17-minute trade happened at that 15 minute traffic up right there and you wait for the high probability price action which means you probably waited a couple of days before you got to that high probability price action and then you can sculpt sculpting is not getting involved every day every session every minute and again like a great investor once said the stock market is a device for transferring money from the inpatient to the patient that is the exact same thing with trading perfect let's continue so again that could be a second entry in the same exact London session right there then if we look at the following day what do we see because on the next day we have NFP and again NFP when you're scalping is beautiful and let me tell you why usually it just follows along with what the higher time frame was already intending to do what do I mean by that our daily bias was already bearish coming into that NFP day so when we see a huge Spike higher that is perfect because remember what we're doing at sculpting we're having that pea Ray or any PD array which we sting into at the right time so there's a Kill Zone or that is news when you have that and you see an entry pattern right there at that moment that is where you want to get involved so for example news stings into that one hour order block with that fair value Gap right there our daily bias was still bearish we had no reason to go higher from this level right there so right there if we go into the one minute again then we can see we now have a boundary to go into the lower time frame because we tapped into that one hour PD array with at the right time and again you need to understand you're not trading NFP itself here you're not executing on NFP you wouldn't do that you wait for NFP to show where it's going it stings into a certain PD array and then you just wait for your entry pattern after the NFP release that's the same for CPI fomc so we have an st right there then we have a new Fairfax app right there and we only sting into the first for Value Gap again right there you could take an overlapping part as well depending on your trading plan do you want to choose just a fair value Gap or always an overlapping part make a choice pick your poison then you cover again the intermediate term high right there and you again Target a one to two now again you can see the same exact thing what we just saw on this entry to the left right there this entry is not that great to be honest so again what you could do and what I would advise is you just take a five minute St instead of using the one minute right there and you just take a five minute St off of that move right there and then again same premise if we leave behind a 15 minute PD Ray ideally a 15 minute fare value Gap that you want to use that 15 minute fair value Gap to act as a new boundary to then go into the one minute time frame again and this right here is how you sculpt in the right way and the things you need to avoid doing those are probably even more important so again you still need context even if you scalp don't be lazy if you're lazy you will get left behind your competition will out work you don't worry in this video you can see how I basically debunked all the hype that we have nowadays all the concepts that are taught in this trading plan is everything you need more fancy does not equate to making more money so you won't see me coming out with the new best concept and this will give you 100 win rate yes don't get me wrong I can be clickbaity but I truly want the best for you and I can see through a lot of in this industry and then as well of course our slogan are you here to figure out an algorithm or are you here to make money more knowledge on a certain algo does not equate at all to making more money please have that at the top of your desk in front of your monitor wherever you want it I have that somewhere because whenever you get distracted by someone telling you the algorithm is now doing this this is that you don't need to know that always focus on making money stop trying to chase 100 win rate by figuring out some kind of Argo because you can either get left behind whilst others are just making money very comfortably or you can spend your entire lifetime trying to figure out an algorithm which will truly not benefit you that much if you do want more insights again go take a look at reo.io there I have my mentorship and I have a newsletter it's a completely free newsletter where I share very personal insights into trading as well and of course if you haven't seen the daily bias video which was the previous video of the a2c guide episode you can click on it here right now and I highly advise to watch that remember that I'm rooting for you I want the best for you and I think you came into trading for either one of the two reasons Freedom or money and that's exactly what I'm trying to teach here again I believe in you alright perfect thank you thank you foreign
