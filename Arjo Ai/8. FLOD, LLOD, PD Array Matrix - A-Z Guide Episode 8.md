all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video now we are slowly starting to get into the more advanced stuff and I'm absolutely loving it I'm very excited for it so in the previous seven episodes so the first seven episodes that you watched on the A to Z guide they were touching on PD erase so that is premium erase and discount arrays so either bullish arrays or bearish arrays and these BD rays are where price can reject off of where price can potentially push a higher from or pushlower from so these PD Rays what that creates is a PD array Matrix now obviously that's just a very fancy word and I'm going to dive into price and show you exactly what that is ETC now in the top right you can probably tell there is flood and there is lot that is first line of defense and last line of defense so if we take a look at this price action lag right here we have a swing high right here and a swing low right there dead in itself so this right here is a price action lag that is a price action lack we arefocusing on right now again swing High swing low is something we will get into don't worry just keep in mind that this is a price action lag inside that price action lag inside that price action lag we are scouting in this case obviously also with the help of hindsight we are looking at bearish prices so we are scouting for all premium arrays so please do me a favor and go over all the premium Rays inside that price action lag there is verify Gap right there overlapping with this order block then we have this River Gap but there is alsoa BPR and then the last one is that high and that high is a liquidity pool so in this case we have a first line of defense what is our first line of defense here Dead Further Gap overlapping with that order block that is our first line of defense now we can even argue of course at the absolute first line of defense right here is this fair value Gap because the order block line is a little bit higher as you can see right there and then the last line of defense is what that high so when we have a retracement and we cansee the retracement is happening right there when we have that retracement one of those PD arrays should hold so right there we have a first line of defense and the last line of defense and that is very important for you to understand so if we move on right here we are having a new price action lag lower we have this swing High we have this swing low inside that what do we create we are creating an order block right there we are creating a fair value Gap right there then we have some sort of rejection block I like the big wickright there and then the last line of defense would be that high right there the first line of defense would be dead that verify again right there what happens right here we are disrespecting this last line of defense so what does that create a new price action lack something new that we can work with what is the recent price action lag right there swing low swing High what is the first line of defense that fair value Gap right there what is the last line of defense that a low That Swing Low right there so ideally we should not come below thatswimming low and again remember the liquidity pulls we can come below this low right here but we shouldn't stay below that low so that is very important so we have a first line of defense and we have a last line of defense obviously inside of that first line of defense and less line of defense we have even more discount arrays as in that high and this or block as well and that makes it interesting because then we can get a clearer view of where price will likely reject off of because obviously we now have a lot ofPD arrays inside One Price action lag and I already told you in the previous videos on where we can expect price to actually reject off of and we see the perfect example in this price action lag and in this price action lag and even in this price I can lag as well right whenever there's multiple overlapping PD rays that is exactly that is the most beautiful place where we want to see price reject off of what do we have here we have that high and we have this verify Gap what makes it two PD arrays two discount racewhat do we reject off of here we have that verify Gap and we have this overlapping order block what does that make premium race what does this right hair make we have this first line of defense but right here we have a verify Gap and we have that order block right there what does that make two discount arrays and then right there this would be your last line of defense That Swing Low and this is your price action lag obviously swing low to swing high so whenever the first line of defense is holding you can probably notice acertain pattern it is usually nine out of 10 times it is overlapping so whenever you see that first line of defense holding and usually first line of defense is 9 out of 10 times it is a fair value Gap and the thing I want you to focus on when we have that first line of defense and it is usually a fair value Gap is that fair value Gap overlapping with another premium or discount array if yes there's a high chance that the first line of defense will hold if it doesn't hold we have certain PD arrays in the middle and then we have that lastline of defense that last line of defense should not get violated should not get invalidated alright so if we take a look at a bit more price action right here we are having right there we have an order block and a fair value Gap right perfectly right there right there this high is the first line of defense right that old high so this high would be your first line of defense so in this case it isn't the fair value Gap but if we take a look just a bit lower what do we see we see two discount arrays overlapping with each otherand that is what I'm trying to tell you that is what makes it so strong now what is your last line of defense right here dead right there that is your last line of defense this load shouldn't get invalidated now the thing I want you to understand is we need to think in probabilities so yes sometimes it might bounce off of a fair value Gap without an overlapping PD array yes sometimes it might not even get into different value Gap and it might just take off yes sometimes the last line of defense will get violatedand price will still continue in that intended direction that we first had and that is completely normal because this stuff this trading stuff is not binary and that's where a lot of people go wrong they think it is binary they think when I tell someone it is low probability conditions that you should 100 lose because low probability conditions oh you should lose it's binary and that's absolutely not the case trading is probabilities and when I tell you it is either high probability or low probability it isabout probabilities it is not binary yes you can still win in low probability conditions yes you can still lose in high probability conditions but the odds in high probability conditions are way more in your favor so let's say we have an 80 win rate in high probability conditions and we have a 20 win rate in low probability conditions yes there is still a chance that we can win in low probability conditions but always ask yourself if you had a million in capital or even 10 million in capital would you risk it ona day where you know the odds are not in your favor and that's the same for those fair value gaps when these fair value gaps are not overlapping with another PD array just know yes they could still play out but the probabilities are way higher when you wait for it to come into effect that is overlapping with another PD array and that is so crucial for you to understand that these these things are not binary and that's what a lot of people think and it might seem very obvious what I'm saying right here but but I've seen somany people that are trading low probability conditions and they tell others oh but I'm winning in low probability conditions yeah yes you are getting very lucky the probabilities are still there's 20 you can win absolutely so you just dodged a bullet but if you do it on the long run that is likely not going to end very well and that's the exact same with overlapping PD arrays etc etc all right I want you please to study this study the price action lag study the PD Ray Matrix the first line of defenselast line of defense and also study what happens if that last line of defense does get violated and again remember right last line of defense yes we can take a liquidity pool before we move lower or before we move higher but there's a certain type of invalidation and again that's where you're studying comes in as well and I've mentioned it as well so study that when does the first line of defense hold if it doesn't hold why doesn't it hold see the probabilities play out then on Sunday we have a live stream 8 30 a.mNew York local time so feel free to tune in and we can just have a little chat and if I don't see you at the live stream I will see you on next Tuesday on the next episode on the A2Z guide alright study take care and thank you foreign
