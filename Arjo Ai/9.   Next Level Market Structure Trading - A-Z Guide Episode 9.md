all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video we are going to be touching on swing highs and swing lows now of course there will be different insights as well around swing highs and swing lows and again it is very important here to keep an open mind so whenever I upload a video like I've mentioned before as well this is not only for beginners you will have great insights in my opinion of course if I do say so myself you will have great insights on swing highs andswing lows that you might not have heard before and it is about mastering those Basics that will get you to Mastery and that will in the end make you profitable that is very important so whenever there's a video about swing highs and swing lows for example there will be a lot of people that will think ah swing eyes and swing lows I already know it and when you are close-minded like that then in every aspect of life you will have a very difficult stage to actually learn and develop even more so now that I got my daily little message back intothe video we can get started alright so swing highs and swing lows what is a swing high and what is it swing low it is a three candle pattern so what do I mean by that if we take a look at this candle for example this up candle then to the left of that we have another op candle and to the right of that we have a down candle now in between what you will see is this Wick so we focus mainly on the Wicks right there this Wick is higher than the one to the right of it and higher than the one to the left of it once that down candle closes right thereonce that is closed this high is now a swing High so what you'll see is right here we also have a swing high this candle is higher the wick is higher than the wick to the left of it and to the right of it that makes a swing High one two three three candle pattern once the third candle closes then it is a confirmed swing high no you might have guessed if we turn it around so we invert it here we have one two three this Wick is lower than the one to the left of it and the one to the right of it so that is your swing low and righthere as well this Wick is lower than the one to the left foot and lower than the one to the right of it and here as well here as well those are all swing lows and that's the very basics of a swing low and a swing high and that's how we identify those swing highs and swing lows again a three candle pattern that's all there is to it so if we take another example right here this is a swing high right the candle of the collar doesn't really matter it is more so about the Wicks right here so that Wick is higherthan the Kendall to the left fit and then the candle to the right of it that is a swing high and this doesn't have to be an up candle then right here we have another swing High another swing high right here a swing low right here here we have another swing High another swing High swing low right there another sneaky little swing high right there I think you are probably getting the point right now alright so if we dive a little bit deeper into those swing highs and swing lows these swing highs and swinglows they are sometimes protected we use these swing highs and swing lows to see where price will likely navigate towards and to see which swing highs and swing lows are getting protected of course if swing lows are getting taken out so for example here majority of the Swing lows are getting taken out right here that is indicating that the trend is currently bearish and the swing highs right here are getting protected so when swing Highs are protected and Swinging lows are getting broken that is a very basicapproach of looking at bearish Market structure and when swing lows are getting protected and swing Highs are getting broken they are getting traded through then we have a very basic approach of looking at bullish Market structure so right here we can take a look at this Market structure right here and you can probably see we have a swing high right here this swing High didn't take out that swing High remember the kind of Premium array that is that is a swing failure see how it is now making more sense sothis swing high is protected now this swing high is protected then we have a small swing high right here created that is Swing high is getting taken out take note of that note that that swing high is getting taken out then this swing high is now being protected then we have another swing High here another swing High here they are both getting taken out why take note of it I'm going to answer the question in just a few minutes so right here we have the actual protected High then here we have a new protected swing Highhere we have a new protected swing high and now we are continuing down and then we have reached the draw liquidity AKA where we expect price to trade to and then you will see alright price starts to shift now and these highs that were protected earlier are not that protected anymore so let's get back to the thing I just mentioned why are these swing highs getting taken swing highs should be protected right well there's a very simple and overlooked method that I use if we just zoom out a little bit and go on to the 15 minute time framesee what I just did and see what just happened see how this makes a lot more sense we are reaching into something on a time frame above it so this is where I will always mention the time frame you are trading on should always be in context of the time frame above it there is a go-to sentence that you'll hear me mention a lot of the time if you are trading the 5 minutes for example it should always be in context of the 15 minute if you're taking the 15 minute it should be in context of the one hour if you're turning the one hourit should be in context of the four hour so on and so on and so on so right here that premium array on a 15 minute will have a stronger magnet then on a five minute so five minutes swing highs and swing lows will likely not be protected when there is a swing High that is hovering just below a premium array that is on a higher time frame than the time frame we are looking at for That Swing high so for example right here we have a 15 minute fair value Gap right there then if we drop down into the five minute we have see that swing high is actuallyperfectly making that verify Gap That Swing high on the five minute is actually the fair value Gap low it is the same low as that we just saw of the 15 minute we take a look right here this high this eye of that candle the wick high right there is the swing high on the 5 minute can you now see why a lot of people get aligned sided on the lower time frame and they are thinking oh we took a swing High well we took a swing high so right here we have an entry right there because price took a swing high so now we have bullish Market structure nothat's not how it works and I get it because when you first get taught this stuff then you think all right marks as you Chef so the trends should change now right not quite and this is one of the few tricks so right here you can see as well that is why these swing highs didn't hold because on the time frame above it we were creating a premium rate that we sting into it and then we drop and you will obviously see the same on the one minute time frame but right here you will have a lot of Swing lows andyou can get easily blindsided right here and think all right well we have clear bullish Trend right here let me take an entry right there oh I took a loss and when you're trading like this in my opinion you are trading absolute with a blindfold on every time frame needs to be in context of the time frame above it when you have that you will not have mistakes like these so can you now see why I said in the beginning of the video that what seems like a very basic video is not a very basic video so there isanother thing right we just went over these swing Highs but what happened here we have a lot of Swing highs that just got taken and all of a sudden we drop down again why are we dropping down when clearly the 15-minute Market structure right here is bullish we are taking swing highs we are protecting swing lows aryo just literally told me that if swing Highs are getting taken and swing lows are being protected that a market structure is bullish what the what is going on and this will often you will and you will come across a social mediainfluence or gurus on Instagram on Twitter on YouTube that will tell you and that will sell you a fancy turtle soup entry right here how can we know that it took all these swing highs and then just stopped right there and then it went lower how can we know well let's apply the same logic that we just did on the 5 minute and the 15 minute time frame let's zoom out if we go on to the Daily right here what do we see previous day high that is liquidity above that previous Ai and then what a fair value Gap a dailyfair value Gap aiming for what a daily fair value Gap right there can you see now what I'm aiming at can you see what I'm trying to tell you so on the 15 minute you will get absolutely blindsided right here but if we apply the plot that we talked about in a previous video on The Daily we will already see this coming isn't that absolutely beautiful because first line of defense what's your first line of defense fair value Gap right there daily verified again so on the 15 minute we will not get blindsided and this mightseem like a lot of liquidity but the only thing that is relevant to us is that daily fair value get right there and then right here these swing highs get protected until we reach the opposite draw on liquidity an opposing discount array oh this is absolutely beautiful right um and this is only the start I'm very excited to to already start the next video but you could probably tell how passionate I am trying to teach this stuff this is absolutely beautiful in my opinion so on that note I want you to study this untilFriday and by the way if you want to be attending the live streams you are always welcome we always have a little chat in the live streams if you
