all right welcome back daily profiles we touched on weekly profiles now we are going to be touching on daily profiles now just a heads up this daily profile video will be about Forex I will make a separate one so the next video will be a separate video where we talk about daily profiles on the indices so es NASDAQ ym Etc because it's a little bit different the basic premise behind it is the same though so you will also benefit off of watching Forex if you are a future Trader and if you are a Forex Trader you will also benefit off of that indices video so don't ignore it but just know we will have a separate video on Forex and indices because otherwise I feel like it will be overwhelming and all over the place and that's not in line with our goal here because we are here to have everything structured in a simple manner so daily profiles so first off we need to of course understand the times of the kill zones the kill zones are generally where we see volatility in the market they are Market sessions so during those times is when we expect volatility and of course like I said in a previous episode the day we expect volatility is the day when we have the economic calendar on our site that is important to understand so the economic calendar is in my opinion it is stronger than the kill zones so what do I mean by that I mean that the kill zones are nice they are nice to have an indication of when to trade for example I'm a London Trader not because London is the best moves not because London has the most volatility no because I like to trade London I like trade in the morning that London is the morning for me so I like to trade in the morning and then afterwards I like to be done for the day so let me go over a trade I actually took on EU right here so if we take a look at the daily we came into this daily fair value Gap now right here it is essential if you haven't watched the previous episode on the weekly profile please watch that because I go over the economic calendar in a price action and economic calendar needs to be in harmony now what do I mean when I say that we came into the daily fifth Valley gap on a Tuesday or short on a Monday on Tuesday and on the Wednesday and which they decided to expand Wednesday why take a look at your economic calendar and that is how I avoided losses on Monday and Tuesday I took a winner on Wednesday so right here what did my trade look like my trade was Asia session low sweep right there we swept those Asia lows then we expanded higher now what do I mean by this we had a fair value Gap a higher right there that is what I wanted to see because if we have a fair value higher in this leg then I wouldn't expect these lows to get taken or to get swept so New York was a bit of consolidation then we expanded higher off of news as well and then eventually we hit the target which was that high right there so let's break this down into an easier manner applying the daily profiles all right if we look at the Asus session when is the AC session it is from 8 until midnight open so 20 until midnight open right there zero zero zero zero that is all in New York EST New York local time so I have set at the bottom right I have my time zone set to New York for trading view why well because all the times all the kill zones or the sessions inside trading they are revolving around New York local time so generally that is a misunderstood thing because a lot of people think London session or London Killzone is actually London opening it is not London opening it is an algorithm that opens at that time so summer and winter time that doesn't matter it will always refer to New York local time so if London is now in winter time and London moved one hour back then we wouldn't change the London Kill Zone it would stay the exact same because the algorithm always refers to New York local time so London close London kill zone is always referring to the same times based off of New York local time same for Asia the Asia session doesn't change it is always referring to New York local time let's dive into daily profile so Asia again eight until zero zero AKA midnight open New York midnight open is always at zero zero zero zero then we have London London is 2 am to 5 a.m then we have New York New York is 7 A.M until 10 a.m then a London close is 10 a.m until 12 a.m and then afterwards we start a new day and we start Asia again London again New York again London close again Etc now there are different characteristics of each individual session right here the normal premise Behind These kill zones are Asian range consolidation London sweep of Asia low or Asia High depending on the high time frame bias that we have London makes a low of the day New York retraces into what London created and then expense and then London close makes the high of the day or somewhat the high of the day that is a basic premise behind everything you also have New York reverse you will also see sometimes Asia making the low or the high of the day there are different characteristics for different circumstances how can we know which circumstance will play out by knowing the higher time frame and by reacting to what price is doing simple as that it is as simple as that so for example let me guide you through this trade again right here we had a perfect Asia consolidation Asia lows are getting swept right there keeping in mind we have this daily backup I'm not just trading off of the 15 minute here I'm trading a daily continuation so London creates a fair value Gap whenever London makes a low and creates a fair value Gap so London has a fair value Gap in it New York will likely only be a retracement and won't take out what London has created will likely only be retraced and then a continuation of what London already had established that is a big Point what will London clothes do London close is meant to distribute positions that are there so what does that mean it means that London clothes will take profit it will take profit at what at a liquidity Point remember from the First episodes we need liquidity from someone else so in this case where is liquidity see these equal highs their liquidity so what happens we have a slight retracement right there and London close creates somewhat of a high now generally you don't want to be taking Longs anymore in London close you either want to be involved in London or New York but London clothes is not necessarily where you want to be taking new long if this was a bearish day then London close might be a great opportunity for lungs just like we had a bullish day here this might be a great opportunity for taking short right there on the even lower time frame a little scalp you could say and that's the same with what we just talked about on the weekly profile Thank God It's Friday setups this is your Thursday and Friday right there and you can see the Thursday and Friday right here caps to week and then we have we can we can say we started next week right here we have a Monday and Tuesday expansion again so the Thank God It's Friday setup is right here this move until we rebalance something inside that range again overlapping with what this high is breaker and then we continue higher so you can see that the same characteristic that we had on the weekly profile are actually applicable to the Daily profile as well why because we have Monday your consolidation Tuesday Wednesday and your Thursday and Friday right here so my trade just to show you what's inside this London covering the London lows right there aiming for those highs right there that was my trade all right let's give you another example of this week's price action all right right here we are on Au AKA Australian dollar US dollar now by the way the indicator that I'm using is FX Market sessions by Boy Toki I'm sorry if I mispronounced that that is the indicator that I'm using for this of course I've customized it to my own needs right here I have another indicator as you can see but that is a volume indicator why did I add this it is if I only have this indicator then this is constantly showing and it's pretty annoying to me so that's why I have another indicator right there so that is the indicator that I'm using but I normally I don't have any indicators on my chart and the reason being once you have the indicators actually integrated into your brain you're doing this every single day then you will automatically know if it's London if it's Asia if it's New York Etc your brain will pick up on it you don't need to worry about anymore I don't have the sessions on my chart anymore so what can we see here this is not your typical daily profile is it and this is why it's important understanding the daily profiles the same as the weekly profiles it is not a thing set in stone what do I mean by that you have to react you have to be able to react in this game that we call trading so for example there are certain characteristics still because the certain characteristics that are important here is do we have fair value gaps in the lag lower do we have expansions already from previous sessions and if we already come into a premium rate so for example right here I was looking at AU and Au came into this daily for Value Gap and we could Target a weekly fair value Gap that was sitting right there so on The Daily we are coming into that daily verify gap on the 15 minute what does that look like we have Asia session coming into that daily feather Gap already an Asia session already this place is lower what is the displacement a displacement is a fair value Gap we already have fair value gaps lower can we now logically expect London to take out Asia and then continue lower no absolutely not what we could expect here is like what happened London either retraces and then expands lower but London had no energy anymore to do it so what happened was London retraces right there and then eventually New York continues lower and this is where you have to react because in London there won't be a great setup here if you want to write the expansion again you have to get involved right here in New York and this was a very very clean setup actually and again at the end of New York there's a small setup but right here once we are aiming for these lows you don't generally want to get in anymore not in London close because then you will see price action like this as well and then eventually again same story Asia has that expansion also because Australian dollar is of course more so than Asia pair it is pretty volatile in Asia so you will see a lot more volatility in Asia and during Asia so that's something to be aware of that when you are trading Australian dollar US dollar for example you won't always see the perfectly clean Asia consolidation and the sweep in London Etc no that will not always happen but that doesn't mean it's not tradable because this is very much tradable right here same for this this is very much tradable well once we have reached that Weekly fair value Gap it's of course different story but this is still very much tradable the only thing that changes now is that this this high is now protected and we wouldn't expect this High to get taken out now if this High didn't come into the daily cup just yet and had no displacement it would have been a different story as well but this High came into the Daily 4 backup already displaced lower and then we continued lower in New York eventually so you could even say right that this is your Asia right here London made the high of the week looking at displacement New York had the retracement and the expansion again and London close made the load there the sessions change but the story stays the same right it is constantly consolidation sweep expansion retracement expansion let me consolidation sweep AKA your manipulation expansion to the intended Direction how can we know the internal Direction because of the higher time frame bias then we have a retracement a retracement into what a retracement into some form of value Gap order blocks it is that internal move that we talked about and then what we have the expansion again we want to get involved in that internal move so in a move right here in this New York that is where we want to get involved because then we can write the expansion again that is important to understand so again what is needed here again it is important to understand there's nothing set in stone there are certain characteristics but right here for the daily profile and again we will go into it deeper as well later on after the indices daily profiles we will dive into it deeper again but right here we need to understand the higher time frame first once we have a higher time frame established bias then we can focus on the kill zones on The Daily profile the most important is again that higher time frame that will lead you to your daily profile Etc so let me give you another example all right here we are on GBP US dollar AKA gu AKA cable so here we have a daily fair value Gap again this is also a trade that I took now here we are going to be looking at a New York reversal so you usually have either your London Hive today or low today of course in a bearish day you would expect a high of the day to be made in London or in New York now how can we know it will happen in New York when we dive into the 50 minute and again it is not that difficult to know if it will happen in New York because all we have to do is react so what can we see here we have Asia we have London expansion it actually sweeps Asia low sweeps Asia highs right there but it doesn't create the hive today doesn't create the low today well sorry it actually created the low of the day right here but eventually this is getting taken out to Target these loads of course but right here the main premise is that London didn't make the hive today and New York didn't respect what London did Etc why not how did I know at the time that this wouldn't get respected was it because Asia was a consolidation right there and we knew it it was Asia so we know Asia needs to get swept Etc no it was based off of which session which Killzone sweeps into that daily for Value Gap AKA comes into that daily for Value Gap and then this place is lower that is all that is how I knew it and London did it come into the daily figure no did Asia come into the daily for Vega no so which session or Killzone will likely come in New York what does that create a New York reversal of course this is your hive today that New York right here high of the day New York expands lower and right there that is where I got involved right there that was my entry covering the high and then aiming for new lows right there ahead of the day I can have a great indication of which session will likely come into the daily Fair Gap and then expand lower again this doesn't have to be a daily for Vega can also be a four hour premium array can also be a weekly premium rate whatever can also be even a one hour premium or discount array ahead of the day I can get a great indication because I can see where we are currently hovering so for example in the evening I do an analysis in the evening right here this is around the evening for me then during this time I'm sleeping right here I wake up I can see all right we are now here London is a great opportunity and that is already what I knew when I did my analysis in the evening I already knew all right we are pretty close to the Daily fair value Gap so London could indeed come into the daily for fire gap and then expand lower London expanded lower without coming into the daily Vega there was no trade for me London had a retracement right there and then what New York came into the daily for Vega what does that make your New York reversal it's reacting this game is all about reacting and adapting when this happened that is exactly because I just told you I mainly I'm primarily a London Trader that is exactly when I will focus on New York because New York came into the daily flag and New York expanded lower and then eventually same story London close Etc and then the next day what did we see we had Asia again Asia already had an expansion if Asia already has an expansion and a fair value Gap in the leg can we expect London right here to come all the way higher above Asia and then continue lower no that is not logical now what is the difference I can already hear you asking what is the difference between this entry for example because this could have been an entry very very great entry right there what is the difference between this entry and this entry for example in this for Value Gap or even higher you waited for it to come right here and today what is the difference well then we have to go back to the foundation what is the foundation between our traits daily Gap so we need a higher time frame context first daily 5 Gap where gets a markup maker cell model AKA a cell program gets activated where once we hit an higher time frame premium array what are we targeting when we hit in higher time from premium rate and higher time frame discount rate what is the higher time frame discount array here it is this swing low that is the first higher time for discount rate so on a 15 minute basis what do we see this is just a continuation because we already came off of Premium array on the higher time frame right there this is your continuation until we reach that discount array so it's different because this has not yet came into an higher time frame premium array and again Mark Omega models that is something we will get into so stay tuned alright so again inices is something we will discuss as well in a different video in the next video actually again if you're trading Forex the indices video will also be beneficial for you because it is the same premise but I might have a little different Insight I might explain it a little bit differently and that might make it click even more for you so it's very important to understand and watch every episode again you will not understand it by me just telling you it and watching Netflix after because then this is simply just entertainment for you if you want this to be education you need to start to apply it and you need to send me chart examples maybe even send me all your chart examples on an Instagram or a Twitter but not in DM send me it on a timeline so you actually tweet something you do a markup and tag me in that tweet or you actually place a story on your Instagram and you tag me in that story because DMS are blooded they are all over the place currently so once you actually tweet it to me or actually send me your story then I will notice it way quicker alright so if you want to do that send me your markups I will review them and I will see you at the live stream on Sunday 8 30 a.m New York local time perfect thank you
