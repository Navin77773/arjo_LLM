trading weekly profiles that is exactly what we are going to be touching on here how can we know what weekly profile will play out and what are the characteristics of each individual day as you might hear my voice is a little bit gone so bear with me I will talk as clear as I possibly can for you to understand so there is a certain characteristics for each day and for each week but usually these weekly profiles that are being taught there are so much random weekly profiles that you can make an argument for everything so how can we narrow that down and how can we actually know which weekly profile will happen and will play out or at least have the highest probability of knowing in this case in the top right you see Range High of the week trends Trend again but TR and TGIF Thank God It's Friday don't worry I'm going over each and every one right here so if we take a look at the daily time frame right here on EU again this is applicable to every Market here what do we see this is our Monday Monday is a range here let me actually remove the lines perfect so Monday here is a range it is indecisive it is also a consolidation somewhat now what does this leave behind this creates what a daily fair value cap then on Tuesday we sting into that daily fair value Gap creating what the high of the week then Wednesday is what it is a trend day and Thursday is also a trending day but at the end of Thursday you have to be careful that you're not shorting anymore because when we are getting closer to the end of the week so that is the end of Thursday and Friday we will likely cap the week what is Cap the week mean on a bearish week we will make the low of the week on Thursday or Friday most likely and how can we know if Thursday or Friday makes a low if Thursday already displaces higher shows displacement and signs that it wants to go higher and Thursday as a likely kept at the range and Friday will fail to take out Thursday's low if Thursday doesn't have a displacement and closes pretty low for example here the candle closes pretty low relatively to the wick in this case you will most of the time see a Thank God It's Friday setup where we sweep the previous day low of Thursday and then shoot back up in the range and then we close inside the range how can we know how can we know that the wig will play out like this ahead of time so on a Sunday I want to know how the week plays out well let me tell you you won't you won't know for sure how the week will play out and how the week will form ahead of time but if we take a look and this is where your own studying comes in and this is a big hint from me if you take a look at this week's price action so that is the 15th of May until the 19th of May if you search for the economic calendar on this week's price action you will see where the news events come in on which date they come into the market and on those days that is where the volatility will be on the day of news events that is where volatility will be so for example on Tuesday here we had a news event that news event on Tuesday had the most volatility for that week in order for price to move what does it need it needs volatility so when Monday doesn't have a clear premium array hovering above it and it is somewhat ranging that Tuesday does have a premium array hovering above it right there and it has the volatility price action and the volatility are in harmony that is how you can know how the week will play out and that is exactly how I knew on this Sunday or this week how I knew ahead of time how the week would play out I called on a Sunday where the low of the week will be on which day it can likely happen and where we can expand swords if you don't believe me you can take a look at the live stream on the 14th of May on Sunday and of course since EU is just inversed we were expecting the same for EU so what do I mean with if Monday was hovering below a premium array or there was a premium rate hovering above Monday what do I mean by that well let's say that this was a Friday that Monday might have done this because Monday already had a higher time frame premium rate that it can sting into so if Monday already had a sting into that high time from premium Ray then Tuesday will likely just expand and won't take out Monday's high same for what you see here Tuesday stings into that high time from premium rate so Wednesday is expending it is not taking out Tuesday's High it doesn't need to so what is important here it is crucial for you to understand the higher time frame PD race and the economic calendar reading the candles day by day that is important so if we mark this premium array and dive into the one hour right here what do we see we are coming into that daily verify Gap we are displacing lower right here what is this this is already your one shot one kill one shot one kill refers to catching the weekly range where you generally take one trade a week and you're trying to catch the majority of the weekly range this is exactly how you can do that now what would you target here remember what we talked about we talked about premium array to what a discount array now for the weekly range we will expand even lower than of course just this swing low especially if you're trading on the one hour the one hour if you're targeting this then obviously a 0.77 RR that's not worth it so we target something lower in the form of what what do we see here we have a liquidity pool right there and if I show you the dollar in a few moments it will even be more clear on what your target should be so this can be a Target right there that's enough that is your one shot one kill 2.74 r that is if you can do that consistently on a weekly basis you are out performing a lot of hedge funds and there are a lot of investors that are willing to work with you believe me so we drop down back into the one hour again as you can see right here what do we see we all have continuation trades right there notice how I'm using very value gaps a very value gaps are at the core of my strategy I love fair value caps without fair value gaps I can't operate it is of course a personal thing you might do very well in price action without fair value gaps I do very well in markets with fair value gaps what is this overlapping with as well what did we talk about way at the beginning of the A2Z guide remember the PD Rays mitigation block right there and nested in that an order block as well so there's three there's three levels of Defense right there and if you zoom out just a bit on the four hour right now bare value Gap overlapping again with that mitigation block isn't that beautiful so on Wednesday we continue that Trend but again it is very important for you to understand that there are set parameters that will play out over and over so this format this Tuesday high of the week and Friday in this case low of the week will play out a lot of the times the thing is you are not going to go into Sunday and think Yep this is a Tuesday Hive the week no in the live stream that I did ahead of this week you'll hear me say as well but during the week we would have to adjust and have to react to What happens in that time what I thought of price so on Monday consolidation that exactly played out if Monday wasn't a consolidation here it would have been a whole different story so you react and you adapt constantly same here Wednesday is a trending day and then it suddenly retraces into what something on the higher time frame again into that mitigation block and then it continues on Thursday and then at the end of Thursday you have to be careful that you are not right here off of this for Vega for example that you're not trying to short we have already been expanding lower a lot of Pips this week so at the end of Thursday and going into Friday this is not a high probability shorting opportunity anymore either you got in here on the one hour either you got in here on the four hour and maybe a lower time frame confirmation but don't try to get in here now you are trying to chase price but instead what can we do instead well Thursday doesn't have a displacement higher so what happens right there can you see it previous day low sweep turtle soup boom we continue higher on the 15 minute what happens here well we have this turtle soup liquidity sweep and then what do we have right there isn't that a beautiful entry now what would you target here because obviously this is a bit of a different scenario you are now trying to catch the low of the week it's a bit of a different scenario so what would you target here once we cap the week so either on a Thursday or a Friday we will Target to rebalance something inside the weekly range so if we take a look at the four hour we are rebalancing this fair value Gap with this old block why not this fair value Gap to overlapping premium arrays so at that time once we reached that that is the same premise is that we don't short right here we don't look for new lungs in this premium array so right here take your profit and be done be grateful be happy for that week that's it that's the week done so essentially right here from this sweep boom dead to that area to this area that is where you want to play that is where you want to get involved after we reach that you don't want to get involved anymore so from this area to this area what is unfolding on the lower time frame a market maker buy model from this area to this area what is unfolding a market maker shell model again marker make buy models marker make cell models and kill zones and due to swings everything we will go over in the ATZ guide it is called A to Z guide for a reason now as well how can we know where the weak will likely close I would like to invite you to draw your Fibonacci on the low of the week to the high of the week of course at that time we don't know for certain if this is the low of the week we can make a guess this die of the week of course because we've been expanding lower and we can now make a good guess that this is the low of the week so when we have that the 0.3 and the 0.2 that is a great indication of where we will close during that week so once we reach this that right there is likely where we will close in close proximity to this area on your Fibonacci too now I already want you to think in The Next Step because this weekly profile is fractal why is this fractal what is so fractal about it remember to kill zones or if you don't know about kill zones don't worry it's something we will get into if you already know about the kill zones let me give you a beautiful hint of what we're going to go into in the next coming videos when we are going to be touching on daily profiles so daily profiles Asian range London if London makes a high of the day what is New York likely going to do retracement continues what London already made what do we see here London close isn't this absolutely mind-blowing it is the beauty of price action this makes price action so beautiful when you understand these Concepts in the A2Z guide everything becomes so clear everything can be done in a mechanical way in a step-by-step manner to focus truly on what our goal is and that is making money in these markets making money from Trading again not Financial advice of course all right now let's give you one more bullish example just to top it off alright perfect so here we are on the dollar now this was the exact same week just to show you what we were looking at and what Target was for that week so right here we came into that daily fair value Gap as well with on a four hour we had this overlapping a high this overlapping mitigation block then we were expending higher and the target was very clear on the dollar because we had this fair value Gap and that is exactly where we kept the week now as you can see on a Thursday we didn't have a huge displacement and Friday didn't take out Thursday's high but look closely what do we have what is this on the lower time frame with EU it is smt uh-huh all right now I want you to show you a couple of different weeks of course because this is only one of the weekly profiles now there is no benefit of me giving you weekly templates because that is not how it works I can give you weekly templates and there will be a dude or a woman who will sit on a Sunday and look at the chart and think Hmm this weekly template it is called the special Enigma template this weekly profile I think this might be the one this week who knows and in that way you are also messing up your mind because when you establish that and you say to yourself This weekly template will play out then you will be so focused on that Weekly template that you will not be reacting anymore that is absolutely detrimental and of course with experience you can acknowledge that so if I tell you on a Sunday this weekly template might play out I know for myself that I will still be reacting and that I might be fully wrong so right here if we take this lag down what do we see we have another weekly profile right here now let me just show you the week in this case it is a bit of a different weekly profile because right here Wednesday makes the low of the week and a high of the week how can we react to this well Monday wasn't necessarily coming into premium Ray it is just an expansion of what we already had last week then Thursday is not even close to any premium array so looking for shorts or logs on that day is futile it is nonsense you are trying to catch a trade in a low probability trading day and then right here this is interesting because now we have a liquidity sweep right there what can we target this fair value Gap and right here we can already start looking or short going into Thursday going into Friday see how the general parameters of the weekly range are the same but I'm reacting and the economic calendar was different during this week why because we had CPI on a Tuesday and after that after CPI the volatility comes into the market boom right there there it is coupled again with a news event making the high of the week and even the low of the week now if we continue what do we see here we already see we are coming out of this BPR this fair value Gap this breaker We are continuing lower we are still expanding lower when Monday expands like this can we now expect Tuesday to do something like this and then consumer no that is very illogical those are not characteristics of price action right here we had a pretty low close as well now if this Tuesday was a pretty high close what do I mean with a high close we had an up close day and we closed pretty high relatively to the wick and then the odds of seeing a previous day I sweep into a fair value Gap then they are increased that is the thing we saw on EU just now so right here we are just expanding so on the four hour only one hour you might still be able to catch this or like I always say you either get in here or you wait for retracement to get in on the expansion again because if you wait for retracement then you can write the expansion again right here you are chasing price now and again beautiful and this is where you could catch the low of the week why what do we see previous day low sweep Thursday has that displacement that we talked about so right here be very careful we've been expanding lower we are arriving at a Thursday the TR and it's called that for a reason because the trend might just end and we have a displacement a higher right there and then we continue even higher on that Friday so knowing the PD arrays knowing when we will stick into it how can we know when we will stick into it economic calendar volatility we need volatility to trade and reacting and adapting to different days there's not one single weekly template that happens every single week you have to be able to react and adapt where are we currently on which day are we there where are we currently are we hovering below or above a premium or discount array is volatility coming into the market can we sting into that PD array can we then continue that Trend where will the trend likely end for that week all questions you can ask yourself there's a step-by-step method this is all stuff we go very in depth on inside the master class and inside the mentorship in general also the basic because the mentorship knows what I'm talking about and the mentorship also knows how valuable these videos are because mentorship members always come up to me and they say are these videos on the A2Z guide they are absolutely incredible they match the content of the mentorship perfectly and that's what I'm here for right I am here to help you make money from Trading not Financial advice alright study this and I will see you on Friday at 8 30 on a new A to Z guide episode perfect thank you foreign foreign [Music]
