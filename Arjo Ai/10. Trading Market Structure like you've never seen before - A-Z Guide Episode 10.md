all right hello everyone hope you're doing all right welcome back to this new video and we are going to be touching on Market structure and we are going to be touching on it even more in depth even more advanced we are truly going to take this to a Next Level so in this video I want you to truly take note of everything that I do because this is going to be a huge game changer and the insights I will give you are truly game changing in my opinion of course if I do say so myself but the thing is you need to pay attention that is very importantas well just a quick little announcement the masterclass enrollments are currently closed but there is a waiting list currently going on so what that means is once that waiting list is full I will not enroll any new people anymore and after this month so at the end of June the enrollments will open but in July in August and Romans will not open anymore and we are going to be focusing on the group that we have right there so if you want to be a part of that you want to be a part of those amazing Traders with even more insightswith way more details and a step-by-step guide to becoming a profitable Trader and allowing me to help you in putting everything together to get to that profitable stage then I would highly advise to check the first link in the description and join the waiting list alright without further Ado let's get right into it so in the top right what do we see we see sth and STL short term high and short term low then beneath that we have ith and itl intermediate term high and intermediate term on low so you need to understand both of theseconcepts are Market structure they they combine to make up Market structure and both of these are swing highs so when we truly outline it we get to this point right we have Market structure that leads to intermediate term high and short-term high and that leads to swing highs and then we talked about it the other way around so we went from doing highs to now intermediate the high short-term highs and then marked structure so if we dive into it right here but when we combine these swing highs and swing lows what do we get well if wetake a look right here what do we have here we have dead swing low and if we take a look at the left of that of this swing low what do we have we have another swing low right here and notice how this swing low is a little bit higher than this one and what do we have to the right of the middle swing low right here another swing low and this is a little bit higher than the one that we just talked about the middle one so this middle one has a swing low higher to the left of it and a swing low higher to the right of it that creates the middleswing low is an intermediate term low so only this swing low is now an intermediate term low the low to the left is a short-term low and the low to the right is a short term low as well so whenever there is a swing low that has another a higher swing low to the left of it and another higher swing low to the right of it then the middle low is an intermediate term low so if we inverse that and take a look at short-term highs and intermediate term highs we can already spot one I believe right if we take a look at this the mostclear one right here what do we have this is a swing high right then to the left of that what do we have as well another swing high that is a lower to the left of it and then what do we have on the right side for simplicity's sake let's just take this one right now we have another swing High AKA another short-term High lower to the left of that middle swing high this is now this middle swing high is an intermediate term high this is a short term high and this is also a short term high if you paid attentionright here you can probably already tell that currently we are on the daily time frame so if we zoom in a little bit in this price section what would we see we have a swing High here we have another swing High here and then we have another swing High here what is this high intermediate term high on the lower time frame so refractal thing so understand that this is an intermediate term High Why understand that it has a swing High lower to the left width and a swing High lower to the right of it now let's diveinto it even deeper after sweeping this intermediate term High what do we see we see a huge rejection then what do we actually get right here we see a fair value Gap right there and we have a previous day a high inside that fair value Gap right there then if we drop down into the one hour first and we are aiming for that alone that is our first drone liquidity so if we take another look at the daily we had that daily February Gap with that previous day I sweep what is the first discount array a liquidity pool what is actually a liquidity poolliquidity pool exists of what swing highs and swing lows so the first discount Raider We Touch is what That Swing Low right there there is your first discount array aka the first area where price is in discount short term discount so right here we are coming off of a premium rate and targeting a discount array note that down please that is very important to understand to frame the ID of Market structure premium to discount rate then what do we see if we zoom in again on the one hour and right here we have what right herewe have that short term High which is what that was the previous day hide that we are sweeping then the next thing we see is we have a sweep above that high into the daily fair value Gap now ask yourself what do we see here we see intermediate term High short term High short term High this intermediate term High is holding until when until we reach that first draw on liquidity and what do we see as well short-term High short term High short term High they are holding until when until we take an opposing intermediate term lowwhenever we take an intermediate term low which was this first discount array that is on the one hour our intermediate term low whenever we take an intermediate term high or an intermediate term low we can expect most of the time a bigger retracement so what will price do in between moving from note this down in between moving from intermediate term High to now an intermediate term low which is your drawn liquidity in between that short-term Highs are protected let me repeat that for you so you can write it down properly when we move from apremium array to a discount array and we are aiming our draw liquidity is this intermediate term low then we create an intermediate term high at the premium array that we established that premium array will push price lower will create an intermediate term High all the short-term highs that are in between that intermediate term high and intermediate term low will be protected until we reach that intermediate term low after we reach that intermediate term low the high that will be protected is now the intermediate term Highthat's a whole sentence again maybe repeat that a couple of times and compare it with what I just showed you in price action and that will be absolutely a big game changer so what I just said let me actually break it down right here in the chart so what do we see right here we are coming into the premium Ray what is our first Target a discount array what is that discount rate as well it is an intermediate term low on what on the one hour right here an intermediate term low when we come into that premium array on The Dailyright here it could be any time frame by the way yet this is all fractal but when we come into that premium array right here on the daily we are expecting an intermediate term High to be created now right here we push lower then what do we have next we have another short-term High created right here these highs this one this one should hold until when until we reach the opposing discount array AKA when we reach the intermediate term low so these short term highs this one this one this one should hold until wereach the intermediate term low once we take that intermediate term low we can expect a bigger retracement and now the high that is protected are not the short-term highs anymore the intermediate term height that was formed at the premium array that is the one that is protected right now so a bigger retracement would absolutely not be mind-blowing that is completely logical and is still a healthy pullback a healthy retracement again there is a lot of information to take into right now but we are going to go even deeper sowrite it down take notes watch it a couple of times you're going to need it alright so now let's dive into price a little deeper so what do we see you actually I think you probably noticed it right what do we actually see we are sweeping a high right here and then right here we create a high and we have some sort of intermediate term low right here but as I also like to call it the intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows are absolute Outsiders they are on the outside of your chart so if we take a look right here these are onthe absolute outside of our chart these intermediate are high and intermediate term low this is one that's still in the middle of a range so if we now zoom in on this price I can taking in into account that high that high that high and that high let's zoom into the 15 minute right here what do we see now we have something more to work with but if we take a closer look what did I just tell you I told you that short-term highs will hold until we take out an intermediate term low once we have taken that intermediate turn low we can expect abigger retracement a bigger pullback and now the next high that we'll likely hold is what an intermediate term High so when you take a look at Price action right here and now we are a bit more zoomed in so these highs on the 15 minute time frame are not short-term highs anymore they are what they are now intermediate termized so intermediate term High intermediate term high and in between intermediate term high I would call it then we have another intermediate term High intermediate term High intermediate term high and can you seeon a 15 minute time frame are drawn liquidity AKA or intermediate term low is already closer so we had this one then we had this one then we even had this one a very small intermediate term low and can you now see when the bigger pullbacks are happening aha there's something there there is something there so can you now understand what the next step is the next step is before we take out these intermediate terminals on the 15 minute if we zoom in on the one minutes what would actually happen well let's note these lows right herejust so we have a bit of a clearer view where the pullbacks are happening and what you will notice when we move from this height to that low in between that price action that is where you will have the highest probabilities of short-term highs on the one minute holding of course remember this is all fractal all fractal stuff but we are now going to look at on the one minute time frame is essentially the exact same thing that we just looked at on the one hour time frame so let's dive into the one minute time frame on this lag rightthere alright so this is the exact same price action that we just had on the 15 minutes now what do we notice I think you get it by now right I think you have a great understanding so this is the previous day hi that was swept and that is where we are coming into that daily fair value Gap as well so if we move this one a little bit higher what do we actually see intermediate term High right here where is your first intermediate term low right there what do we get after we take out that intermediate terminal we get some sortof bigger pullback right there now in between that price action when we take out that when we have that intermediate term High and then we have that intermediate term low in between so that is this price lag down that is where your short-term lows will hold afterwards when we take out that intermediate term low we can expect a bigger retracement now what did we talk about on the previous episode a retracement into what probably some sort of Premium Ray on what a higher time frame than the one minute sump kind of Premium rate that is on thehigher time frame not on the higher higher time frame that is on the time frame above the current time frame you are looking at so we are looking at the 1M every time frame above it there will likely be some sort of Premium array and price will reach into that exact premium array so if we take a look at the five minute what do we reach into a five minute fair value Gap AKA a five minute premium array five minutes is above the one minute yes now let's take a look again at the one minute ride here what do we see until we deliver to thatdrone liquidity that intermediate term low right there intermediate term High new your new intermediate term high right now so if we take out that low debt intermediate term high should now hold because this intermediate term High happened after that taking that intermediate term low so this was your retracement into that five minutes per value Gap then we continue lower this intermediate term high should now hold until we reach that intermediate term low after we take that intermediate term low what intermediateterm high should now hold this right here so if you've taken notes you can see there is a step-by-step process behind this stuff we have an intermediate term High in creation right there then we have an intermediate term lowest Target in between short-term highs should hold after we take that intermediate term low we can expect some sort of bigger retracement into what into a premium rate that is above the one minute time frame so that we are currently blind too but if we zoom out on the five minute time frame there willlikely be a premium rate again fractal if this was a 15 minute price action lag then we would likely reach for something under one hour then we would likely reach into a premium rate on the one hour or maybe even a four hour and which high in their process should now hold when we've taken out that intermediate term low that intermediate term High oh man this episode is oh man maybe I'm giving away too much I'm not sure if I'm able to share this FBI please FBI just called me they're like Ariel come on manwhat are you doing no I'm just joking but this is great information and and again it is up to you if you want to use it right it's up to you but in my opinion I would know what I'm doing so right here intermediate term hype which is priced lower than right here we have an intermediate term low as well right there somewhat of a big retracement into that fair value Gap don't need to hire time frame for this one right here and as well sometimes it will be very clear like here on the one minute you don'tneed to zoom out right here you could just use the one minute right here but for this right here we only have swing highs we don't have a clear Target right here then this is where I would zoom out and get a clearer view of price action so then we deliver lower now what do we see we have this intermediate term high after taking out that one then what happens next we retrace we have a big retracement what do we have retracement to remember what I told you our value Gap but not only for Value Gap what is itoverlapping with mitigation block right there that is what you would want to see two premium arrays at the same exact spot then we continue somewhat lower right here we have short-term highs holding and then we fill a little bit then this intermediate return low is currently still rejecting a little bit higher right there and again right there is completely normal we need to know that we are working with probability so these things are not 100 they may be 90 no 90 is still insanely good but just know that one of those 10 days there will bea shitty day and that's just that just is what it is if you understand the A to Z guide and you work on yourself and you follow the steps are outlined you will get as close as the Holy Grail as you can get and that Holy Grail that is you you are the Holy Grail exactly you the beautiful person that is currently listening to this you are that Holy Grail and I'm here too show you that and I'm here to let that Holy Grail show to the whole world I want you to shine as bright as possible so if we continuehere right here we have intermediate term high again then we could be aiming for that intermediate term low right so in between here what do we see again we have these short-term highs holding until we reach that intermediate term low but until we reach and that's why I put the line the intermediate term low we had established on the 15 minute time frame what is next we know that this intermediate term high should now be holding right this intermediate some high should ideally not get violated at all so why this intermediate term highand why not this one remember we are still in this bigger fractal picture so this is still a short-term high on what was it the one hour and an intermediate term high on the 15 minute and this intermediate term high was the retracement after taking that intermediate term low so this one should not get violated right now then we see the exact same thing happening over and over and over and over and over and over and over now this was a very Advanced lecture and we are not done yet because if you've taken notes you will know thatmarket structure is not just one thing on its own and you have the world at your feet no I know how to frame my mark structure and I know how I made it look so beautiful because context of the PD erase that we touched on in the first eight episodes that is what makes it so beautiful combining every single piece the flood the lot the swing Heist the fair value gaps the order blocks everything and especially the flood and the lot so the first line of defense and last line of defense combining that with your structure having a clear drone liquiditywhich I just touched on I just at the beginning if you didn't take notes you didn't catch it I just touched on the Drone liquidity again everything in harmony oh you are going to have an amazing time in the markets so study this this is a pretty long and intense lecture so you might want to watch this a couple of times and me just telling this to you won't make it click yes you might hear a little click but the big click will happen when you study this yourself so if follow the steps I outlined and and go give it a study whenyou do have the free time and that will absolutely give that big click for you and that is when you you are the holy girl and that is when you the Holy Grail will shine eventually so again reminder for the man to ship the master class is currently closed
