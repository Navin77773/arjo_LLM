there is another vague Concept in the trading industry of course there's a lot but this one particularly I've never seen a clear answer to it and the vague concept I'm talking about is how far can price retrace before we continue or in other words where will price likely retrace towards before we expand again that is exactly what we are going to go over in this video again adding on to the previous episode is just as mechanical I will give you another entry opportunity another entry pattern you can potentially use because of course I am trying to get you to find your own entry pattern that fits your personality we have a lot of different personalities watching these videos exactly the reason as to why I'm showing you multiple entry patterns that you can potentially use find the one you like and stick to it run away with it and show me your results on Twitter wherever you want let's get into it so the first thing from the previous episode what was important again the context was important right the context is the most important part again what was the context in the previous episode it was moving from this video to PD array right here what are we doing on the higher time from on ES again we are going to go over innis's and Forex right here if I go to the Daily time frame we can see we are coming into that daily fair value Gap right there alright let's just take the daily for Vega if we zoom in on the one hour again we can see we had a nice rejection higher we have a few fair value gaps higher right there once we see this expansion higher alright we have a great idea the price might want to continue higher it might want to continue heading towards a premium array on The Daily time frame which was we first off have this fair value Gap right there and then afterwards we of course have this high right there as our ultimate draw on liquidity so let's stick to that high driving back into the one hour time frame we have this expansion but what can price now do what can it retrace towards first off what is the range that is causing that move higher that is causing this expansion higher it is what it is that range this swing low towards That Swing high right there that is AKA your dealing range right what we talked about in a previous episode and based on Market structure as well what is now your new engineer the term range it is this right there if you want more advanced insights then don't forget to visit my website oreo.io there's a link in the description as well sign up to that newsletter and that is exactly where I send more advanced insights so we have determined this is the range from this swing low to this swing High then if we draw a Fibonacci right there from That Swing Low to That Swing High hey we see a new Fibonacci setting we have something new to work with we have one and zero of course one is a swing low zero is at swing high that is your range then we have 0.79 0.7050.6180.5 and that makes up your optimal trade entry o t e 0.705 that is exactly your OTE level 0.5 is your equilibrium everything above it is in Pre premium everything below it is in discount I can already hear your brain crackling and making these songs because you're asking what is the relevance of this because we didn't even come into that OTE level exactly the point that is exactly the point I want you to use this OTE as a guideline but there's something else that is more important can you notice something else something that we have actually already touched on in the A2Z guide previously which is overlapping PD race so close to the 0.5 close to your equilibrium you will likely have overlapping PD Rays what is an overlapping PD Ray an overlapping PD Ray are just basically summed up two PD Rays at the same exact spot what do we see here we have a breaker right here overlapping with what a fair value Gap right there Deb makes up two discount arrays this fair value Gap alone is what it's first in premium of course and it is one discount array there's only one fair value Gap with nothing overlapping that overlapping discount array close to your equilibrium level doesn't have to be in discount doesn't have to be in discount remember that doesn't have to be at your OTE level because we will not always reach that OTE level the strongest magnet before we expand further is the overlapping pdra spot that is the strongest part so I'm going to exactly explain how you can use this in your trading plan right here we have this overlapping breaker with the overlapping fair value Gap right there we know already based on a one hour time frame and the context is the daily fair value Gap right there towards the daily highs right there alright we might want to continue higher so on a one hour time frame what can we retrace into before we continue higher the overlapping PD array right there close to equilibrium perfect right there and then we continue higher now will you enter on the one hour that is possible you can enter on the one hour right there that is already in entry but I know of course some people don't like one hour entries so this is all fractal because now we can dive into the one minute right in this area and look for another entry but first off before I dive into the one minute what do we need well before we look for an entry before we see how far a one minute time frame can retrace Etc don't we need some kind of contact what is the context here on the one hour discount array right there towards what first premium array right there ultimately this premium array right there that is your account if you're entering on a one minute don't think you can Target the daily highs it all is relative it's all in perspective if you are entering on the one minute you wouldn't have weekly Target that's not logical the time frames are not in alignment with each other right there right now they are in alignment with each other one minute entries One Minute Target that is important to understand so right here we go into the one minute time frame all right perfect so here we are on the one minute time frame now this is your one hour breaker your one hour overlapping PD race then here we had the first Target and here we had the second target now let's look how we can use the overlapping video race concept and the OTE concept to get to an entry first off I'm not going to dive into how we can potentially see the market shift that is an episode that is coming your way in the ATC guide don't worry I just need you to understand that we are moving higher here and that we have a breaker right there so this right there is what it's a breaker with that breaker we have something overlapping right we have this overlapping fair value Gap now that right there is already your first entry let me tell you I love fair value gaps where price will retrace towards and how far price will retrace the answer lies in overlapping pillars and in Fair Value gaps you first off need a fair value Gap and in every example you will see what I'm showing you here there's a fair value Gap there's a certain fair value Gap right there whether it's on the same time frame or a time frame above it there is a fair value Gap right there fair value gaps tell you a story for Vega will tell you where price will likely draw towards and fair value gaps tell you how far price will retrace because if there's a verified Gap right there and it's overlapping with a breaker the rule on your entry time frame right there is enter on the first place where we have overlapping period an overlapping PD Ray is a fair value Gap overlapping with another discount array in this case of course if we are looking for short we would look at a premium array where is the first place where we have a fair value Gap overlapping with another discount rate this breaker and this verify Gap now if you want to refine it and of course be my guest you can use the OTE right here and you can draw it like that enter on the order block right there close to equilibrium overlapping with the fair value Gap something along the lines of that right perfectly fine if you want to refine it like that perfectly fine but the thing is you need a set entry pattern that you can stick to and the reason why this is important because otherwise you would one time enter on the breaker right there one time enter on equilibrium right there that is exactly why I'm giving you the rule enter on the first overlapping PD Ray the first overlapping PD Ray right there for your entry pattern is this breaker with that for Vega because then you have no excuse to then sometimes use OTE sometimes use the order block sometimes use this no first overlapping discount array in this case so boom there is your entry now what would you cover SL placements stop loss placements is also something we are going to go into in more detail one step at a time but what you're going to cover here is the intermediate term low which is right there perfect you don't get stopped out right there and we continue higher right there with the first Target being this High second Arc being that high right there now let's say we wanted to wait a little bit longer again and we saw this expansion higher again expansion why is it an expansion this fair value Gap higher in order for us to enter the first question we always ask or subconsciously ask is alright if I want to enter how far will it actually retrace that is a question you ask yourself right so what will it retrace into REO set the first overlapping PD Ray mitigation block with an overlapping what fair value Gap right there so you enter off of that fair value Gap right there now you notice how I am entering on the fair value gaps because I I love perfect and that is exactly what makes it mechanical what could also make it mechanical is you enter on the exact spot where we are overlapping with the PD Rays so for example that will make the entry a little bit lower right there that would make this entry a little bit higher right there with the same stop loss placement of course stop loss placement right here beneath that intermediate term low right there Target firstly that Target second target right there and we continue higher continue higher and right here what happens what happens let's see if you paid attention to the market structure video what happened here this lag bills but why because this is just a perfect entry right overlapping for Value Gap overlapping order block but what happens remember the structure video remember what do we see boom we take out an intermediate term high so what is expected a bigger retracement so what do we see we draw the Fibonacci on the intermediate terminal towards the new intermediate term High towards the new Target right there what is close to equilibrium this order block with what a 15 minute pair value Gap and the reason I zoom out there is because if you remember if we retrace after taking the intermediate term high or any intermediate term low we usually retrace to something on on the time frame above it so the one minute needs to be in context of the time frames above it in other words you are forming your context again you need to form that new context again because if we look this from a very mechanical perspective like we touched on in the previous episode as well we moved from this one hour discount rate to that one hour premium array that is on the lower time frame an intermediate term high right there we get a bigger retracement right there we know that if we have a bigger retracement and these lacks fill it is because after taking an intermediate term High We retrace into what we retrace into something on the time frame above it and what did we talk about in the previous episode we hold in the area of context price is the highest probability in the area of context what is the area of context it is this from the discount to the premium rate this part right there on the right side right here that is where you want to get involved after we take out that height that first Target you want to wait for new contacts what is your new context equilibrium 15 minute per Vega targeting again that same one hour high can you see how I'm doing the same exact thing as that we did on the one hour that context first and then we have a reason to go into the lower time frame a lot of people don't understand a lot of people they go into the one minute time frame without having any boundary there's no boundary there needs to be a boundary to go into the one minute time frame if you are going into the one minute time frame without having a boundary you will always have a reason to trade if there's always a reason to trade then that's not high probability is it because there's always a reason to trade everyone can make up a reason in the market to get in everyone can justify a trade ID everyone but very little people know when to look at a trade ID and when to get involved that is the difference that is what differentiates amateurs from professional so afterwards we reach that on the one minute we continue higher right here then what happens again what do we see we see this fair value Gap reaching only into that perfect why there's a breaker right there afterwards again same story what do we retrace into this overlapping with what this old high as well that mitigation block now because remember this whole move is now a swing failure and a fair value Gap right there or block this is actually three discount arrays because here you have a fair value gap an order block and a mitigation block right there that is perfect all right let's give you one more example all right here we are on GBP Australian dollar now the first thing I want you to understand is that we will not always retrace back into an overlapping Fairfax with an overlapping PD array there are certain conditions when this doesn't happen these conditions is exactly what we will also go over in a later episode don't worry right here first off what do we need again context we need context what is the context here overlapping discount arrays two overlapping discount race preferably minimum two overlapping PD race we have one very Gap sitting right there then we also have one small little breaker right there perfect I like that now if we retrace back into that right there now we have a boundary we have a reason to go into the lower time frame what is the first Target first Target is that what is the second target second target is and the ultimate Target is right there if we head into the five minute right here here we see an expansion but not a large retracement and then we expand higher again alright no worries because if we now look at the overlapping discount race again what is the first overlapping discount array that we encounter the first overlapping discount array is what it is this order block right there with that rare value Gap right there exactly there is our entry now I can hear you think where would you put your stop loss would you put your stop loss right here no you wouldn't you absolutely wouldn't that is not a great stop-loss placement and let me explain why again we are working with probabilities here I am doing something that's Based on data I am doing something that works based on probabilities again that is why the belief the market is not random that belief is very dangerous so I know there is a small chance right there that price might do something like this because they're still for if I get right there and this is intermediate term low ride so we shouldn't take that out now I know of course like we've talked about in a market structure video as well if we haven't taken out that intermediate term High aka the Target right there and obviously the short term ranges right here will likely hold until we take that out but that is based again on probability nothing works 100 of the time in the market so right here this could very well all do something like this and then continue higher and if you've done so much work you have done so much work based on finding the context based on waiting being patient and then you absolutely mess yourself up on the entry and you miss the boat you found your entry pattern the context is there everything is there but you mess yourself up and you don't reward yourself that is the worst thing you can do so rather than being greedy and finding the best RR and flexing on Instagram and flexing on Twitter why not giving your stop-loss some room to breathe putting it at the breaker or even putting it at the intermediate term low right there covering the bodies of the candles right there that is perfectly fine then you have a one to two right there and you have a one two five right there that is absolutely beautiful I would rather actually make money and be a part of the move than constantly getting stopped out because I want the best RR and I want to flex on no just catch the move reward yourself reward yourself on the hard work that you've done so right here there we get tapped in right there [Music] foreign ly your take profit gets hit and
