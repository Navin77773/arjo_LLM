the daily bias is the most important aspect about trading because if you of course can know where price will likely head toward the next day then it becomes very easy of course I'm stating the obvious there but today I want to exactly go over how you can get to a daily bias very consistently and how I do it as well and I will show you a few examples where the money making team has applied this concept and this week even made profit off of these Concepts again if you don't know the money making team is my mentorship team let's start off with saying that the entry model is completely irrelevant you can get very creative with your Edge model do whatever you like to as long as you get in the market for your daily bias what I mainly use and if you've been here for a longer period of time you will know that I love fair value gaps fair value gaps tell you everything you need to know because fair value gaps are the signs that price is leaving behind when price is planning to do something so what do I mean by that when price is moving higher and it wants to continue going higher price will have fair value gaps telling you exactly what it wants to do and those fair value gaps can lead you to your daily bias and all you need right there is to study the fair value gaps so whenever there's a guru who tells you a fancy concept about getting to your daily bias then just remember all you need is fair value gaps and can you trade without daily bias yeah you can but who will make more money the one trading with a daily bias or without a daily bias the one with a daily bias so if you're trying to trade without a daily bias ask yourself are you just being lazy or is it truly beneficial to you so how do we use these fair value apps to tell us what price will do if we study this piece of price action right here what can we see first off we can see that we are continuing higher right here price is leaving a sign behind because it's leaving a fair if I get behind right there that it wants indeed to continue higher so only having this fair value Gap right there is enough for you to take a trade off of because we're clearly heading towards this high now why are we heading towards that high well because if we read the fair value gaps how many times have we gotten into that fair fire gap that is sitting right there on the left once right there Then twice right there then a third time right there and then a fourth time right there and then here it got fully rebalanced right there does this fair value Gap seem to you like a strong fair value Gap no why not because if there was a strong verify Gap don't you think it would have already pushed price all the way lower somewhere around there it would have never retraced to it strong fair value gaps only need one single retracement towards them to to then expand or drop lower of course that's me stating the obvious but a lot of people don't read price action and they don't take it into account because when we see this we're coming into it that many times and we fully rebalance it right there then these days when we are leaving behind this fair value Gap dead right there you only expect a sting into the fair value Gap right there and you target what the price action where we have no fair value cups left because a lag without a fair value Gap in it is a weaker than a lag with a fair value Gap in it always remember that so this right there is your drone liquidity so that right there is your highest probability price action and then if we continue looking at Price a little bit further we have a fair value Gap there now what is happening there we are disrespecting that provide Gap why are we disrespecting it remember what we did right there with that for Value Gap we fully closed above that verify Gap what are we doing there we are fully closing below that firefighter Gap if price truly wanted to continue high right there don't you think this day would likely have a wick and we would likely see higher prices on that day already and would likely respect that fair value Gap clearly it's not a strong fair value Gap but I just told you that when you have a lag like this with a fervical in it it's a strong leg yes but you need to have your daily time frame in context of your weekly time frame so the weekly did have a very very Gap lower below that leg so that lag is already weak so how can you view that you have high probability and low probability high probability being whenever we have a lag with a fair value in it it's likely a strong lag unless and that makes it low probability we have a lack with a verify Gap in it but on the time frames above it there's a fair value Gap just below that leg and that is fractal that goes for every single time frame then the lag is low probability or of course when there's no fair flag up in the leg then it's also low probability so right there we are trading towards a weekly fair value Gap right there that Weekly Fair fire gap can act as two ways it can act as a magnet so price wants to navigate towards it and it can do what it can push price away again so when we look at this weekly favor Gap right there can you see the difference how we are reacting towards this weekly fair value Gap and that daily for flag up right there we are clearly respecting that Weekly provide Gap now respect and disrespect you look at it on the respective time frame that the Fairfax has formed because of course on the lower time frame we will have disrespect right there and now again it's attention to detail because here we are creating a fair value Gap right there that fair value Gap will it push price lower when we are coming into the fair value Gap the first we need to ask ourselves which one is the stronger fair value Gap the weekly is stronger because of course there's a reason why the daily needs to be context of the weekly because weekly PD arrays are stronger than daily PD rates so the probabilities are already in our favor their price wants to continue higher right here and that gets confirmed when daily pair value gaps right there stop following through lower because if this wanted to continue lower it would have made a new Fair variable lore because remember price are telling you signs on where it wants to go and the signs are the fair value gaps and afterwards we are seeing a new fair value Gap higher right there that fair value Gap again acts as a magnet and we can use it to trade off of afterwards we have a new fair value Gap higher so again what is the bias we are likely continuing higher ride then here it becomes interesting because what are we seeing right there we came into that daily for vegap once on that Wednesday right there and we had a long week and afterwards we take out that low that long width low right there and we come back again in the daily fire gap what is price telling you right there price is telling you right there that this fair value Gap is not strong enough to push price higher because otherwise it would have already done it on that day right there so this day and that day and that day and that day they confirm what they confirm that this daily is not strong enough to push price higher because compare this daily for Vega to that daily for Vega and to this daily for vehicle right there only one sting needed only one sting needed one two three four five six days before we expand higher who are you kidding not us because we know that for backup is not strong enough so if we are continuing lower where are we likely continuing lower from what are we seeing on the way down we created what a daily Fair Gap right there that daily fair value Gap is our premium array to continue lower from what does that create the premium rate to that discount array so there you create what your context what we hammered on so much and I can hear you think what you didn't really go into daily bias let me clarify that first off you need to understand day trading does not mean everyday trading daily bias does not mean that you try to predict every daily candle you try to predict the highest probability candles because when you can predict the highest probability daily candles then you know where to enter now if you want me to give you data data on my personal trading plan how I've been able to use this and outperform every hedge fund in the world and stick to the end and I'll tell you how you can get that data so that daily bias is again filtering out you're filtering out the high probability from the low probability price action if you are trying to trade every day then that means that there is no high probability price action and there is no low probability price action for you well there is but you are just not paying attention to it trading every day means you are neutral professional Traders know when to trade where and when to trade if you can't know where and when to trade then you likely don't have a trading plan set because that is what you need to know so the fair value gaps are leading you to your daily bias why because when we look at this price action again and we zoom out a little bit and we use the verify gaps that we said all right these are high probability for five gaps it was this fair value Gap and that fair value Gap that discount rate to that premium array right there is where you want to get involved that is when and where you want to get involved and then when we look at this fair value Gap right there that is again a high probability and that is where and when you want to get involved because you want to get involved in that discount array and you want to Target that premium array right there and then afterwards same thing goes for this favaga that is where you want to get involved and that is your target right there sorry to interrupt I'm currently editing this video and I just want to clear it up I just want to make it as clear as possible so what I'm trying to tell you throughout this video is I'm constantly trying to tell you you can use the fair value gaps on any time frame because we talked about the time frames being in context of the time frame above it right you have your daily incomes as a weekly weekly in context of monthly etc etc that's with every time frame so the fair value gaps they are acting as a magnet so you can trade towards them if of course they are on the higher time frame you would not trade towards a five minute or one minute fair value that's absolutely nonsense but the four hour daily weekly and monthly they are great indicators great fair value gaps to trade towards them and then once we reach those fair value gaps what can you do well then we can potentially trade off of them to continue higher or continue lower how do we view that and that is exactly what I'm trying to clear up right here how do we view that we view that by respect and disrespect whenever we are wicking a fair value Gap that is when we respect a fair value Gap whenever we are disrespecting a fair value Gap we are closing inside of it or we are closing all the way below it or above it and then of course I mean when we are closing below a bullish verify gap for example this Fair flag up right there that is disrespecting and whenever we close above or in a bearish verify gap for example this verified cap right there that is disrespecting again and respect is what we're seeing here this verify Gap that fair value Gap and that for Value Gap they are only wicking and why is that important the wick because when you can understand and we form a bias here once we have that first Scandal so you don't even need to be trading that first candle right and that's what I'm trying to tell you in the video as well you don't even need to be trading that first Scandal because when you wait for that week then all these candles the one two three four they are obvious they are obvious that they want to expand higher just based off of this day right there so essentially what you're doing you're sacrificing one day to know where the rest of the days are trading towards the same thing with this right here you would wait you wait here before I get being created it can act as a magnet perfect so we might want to trade towards it once we reach that we want to be careful then once we disrespect that this candle is extremely obvious why because there's a weekly Fairfax sitting just below that leg right there and with lag I'm just aiming at your swing low to the swing high that is a lag then the same here once we respect this right there we respect that fair value Gap these days are super obvious so you're you're sacrificing again one day to know all these daily biases right there once we create that daily before I get right there again once we trade into it then here you could take a loss right there but afterwards you recoup that loss by having a winner right there because this is already telling you weak verify Gap strong fair value Gap you wait this day that day that Thursday is where you want to trade that Friday is potentially where you want to be trading no Financial advice perfect let's continue with the video so how can you get involved all you need to do right there is look for a fair value Gap lower on the one hour time frame and you enter off of that so here on the one hour what do you do you wait for one fair value Gap and you wait for a second verify Gap right there and you cover the intermediate term high right there and you target a one to two because one to two is all you need and then eventually when you get used to the trading strategy then you can Target the ultimate loss but always manage risk means gong break even taking profits very important so here we are on GBP New Zealand dollar and this is where the money making team has capitalized on this move right here if we Mark out this weekly Fairfax Captain if we are continuing higher where are we likely continuing higher from discount array to the premium rate right right there so if we drop into the daily time frame you can see that at this moment right here we had a daily fair value Gap sitting right there now when we looked at this pair we were sitting right there and the thing we saw was the following we knew alright if the weekly wants to continue higher then right here the week he will continue higher off of this discount rate off of that fair value Gap if the daily wants to continue lower then we knew the daily will continue lower off of this fair value Gap right there but if the daily wants to continue even lower what will it do it will create a new fair value Gap lower right there so what did we see we saw that on this day so this is a Tuesday and we wanted to trade on that Wednesday and I'll tell you why if we Mark out that low right there and we go into the one hour time frame and here we are on the one hour time frame and what you can see is that once we trade into that low right there that is when we wanted to get involved why because if we Zoom back out to the Daily time frame what did we just do we prevented a daily Fair very Gap from forming which means that this high right there that is your Target because this lag lower does it have a fair value in it no so that lag is what low probability of holding what does that become that Weekly fair value right there becomes high probability of pushing price at least until that high and that leads to your what Your Daily bias just using what fair value gas so again if we'll take a look at this entry then right here if you use the fair value gaps again that alone could be an entry covering that low right there and targeting that high right there and then you get tagged in and eventually it hits take profit right there and here I use the fair value gaps to create my daily bias and I use the fair value gaps to get to my entry model and to my Target and you use the fair value gaps to go break even it's everything the fair value gaps are everything if you can understand this that is so extremely strong now I want to give you an absolute mindset shift and I want to open your eyes so please go towards oreo.io sign up for the email list right there
