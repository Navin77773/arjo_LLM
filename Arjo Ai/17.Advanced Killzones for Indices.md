all right welcome back so today I wanted to touch on daily profiles again and the kill zones that we are going to be using in indices so previous episode was about 4X kill zones now we are going to be touching on Kale zones or the Innes so I'm mainly going to be touching on NASDAQ es and ym that is NASDAQ of course that is enqueue the Futures Contract then we have es which is the future contract for the e-mini S P 500 and then we have ym which is the Dao or us-30 so first let's get the times right Asia and London are the exact same as in Forex but today I mainly want to go over London New York am session and then New York PM session so London is the same from 2 till 5 a.m New York eastern time always New York local time then we have New York am session New York am session starts at 8 30 a.m and ends at 11 am in your New York am session you have equities open at 9 30 a.m from 9 30 a.m until 10 30 am you have opening range and then at 1 30 PM until 4 pm you have New York p.m session then from 3 to 4 pm that is called the closing hour every single one of these sessions every single thing that I just mentioned that certain characteristics and that is exactly what we are going to go over remember that these certain characteristics are all probabilities and that they are all a general rule of thumb we still have to react to what the market is giving us and from there we have something to work with so let's dive into it first of course what are we aiming for right here we just saw a huge move up right there right there I see an order block now the reason right here why I'm not including this wig and I'm ignoring it is usually when there's a huge Wick right there it is mainly because of news and I tend to ignore it completely so then I would just take this order block and ignoring the wick right there alright if we know we can potentially trade into that order block because we just swept some loads discount array to now a premium array right there if we drop into the 15 minute again I'm using the same FX Market sessions right there for my indicator the first thing you will notice right here is probably that the am session and the PM session are very volatile so so indices are mainly very volatile in New York and not as volatile in London if you want to trade some kind of indices during London I would advise to trade ducks that is what I trade for a long time I've traded indices for a very long time for my London I would focus on ducks and for New York session I would mainly focus on ES so right here we are on NASDAQ and that's the same exact thing main volatility of this day is in New York so London almost acts as a sort of Asian range that we just saw in Forex kill zones London is generally not something you want to trade when you are trading indices you want to focus on AM and PM sessions so London consolidation am expansion and PM somewhat of an expansion but less of an expansion than am right there coming into that for our portable block that we just saw the general rule of thumb and this repeats every day is consolidation expansion consolidation or expansion consolidation expansion that is indicating if London is a consolidation am usually is an expansion then afterwards PM is usually also a consolidation the same as London so it switches around every time if London is a big expansion and will have an example of that just in a few moments then am is likely some form of consolidation if am is some form of consolidation then PM session is likely an expansion again so we are constantly moving from consolidation expansion consolation expansion consolidation expansion every single time so if we zoom in a bit here we have London consolidation if we dive into the five minute now the thing I want you to understand the difference between Forex and indices indices is a real liquidity Hunter Forex as well of course it is all based around liquidity but if you're looking to trade liquidity pools for example Turtle soups and you would look for a lower time from entry right there indices are the way to go in this is a love taking liquidity and then running that's what you'll see a lot of times so what we see here is a London consolidation am sweep of London then at 9 30 we have equities open right there 9 30 until 10 30 that is your opening range the opening range usually makes the high or low of the day because that is where the most volatility is there's a lot of volatility coming into the market at 9 30 because it is equities open so ideally you want to get involved after Equity is open now the thing is what you'll see sometimes is when 8 30 at 8 30 we are already coming into an higher time from premium or discount array and 8 30 already expands then 9 30 will likely only be a retracement of what 8 30 created it will continue higher or lower that's exactly the same scenario as that we saw on the previous episode with Asia already expanding London being a retracement of that and then continuing right here we have a liquidity sweep we're making the low of the day right there we are expending higher we have some form of retracement right there then again we are expanding higher the middle in between the am session and the PM session what you'll usually see is another liquidity sweep right here another liquidity sweep before we start running again now why is the PM session again an expansion because I just mentioned consolidation expansion consolidation it is because the PM session has not yet reached the target where was the target the target was the four hour order block right there so you'll see PM session is still expanding so in that case if you're still looking for trades right here maybe off of that fair value Gap right there that is a perfectly fine trade still in PM session as long as you keep the Target right there in mind at 40 PM session can you notice where a lot of volatility comes into the market closing hour closing hour or sometimes refer to Power Hour on 3 3pm until 4 pm that is your bonds closing hour right there you have a lot of volatility coming into the market because price needs to get to that objective quick for that day it still is one hour to do something it needs to do it quick right now so that is where also a lot of volatility comes into the market so indices are very great if you want to be a scalper because you have a lot of volatility coming into the market at certain times of the day if you were to trade to one minute for example I would prefer trading the 1M on the indices instead of trading 1m04x because if we drop down into the one minute what did we just see we saw a London sweep right there and right there we have an entry right there and if we look at the PM session the five minutes per Ferry Gap we just saw right there is also an entry both based off of the St model that I'm teaching inside the mentorship so if you truly want to be a scalper i I would advise to trade illnesses instead of Forex so here we are on ES again important to understand NASDAQ es ym have all the same characteristics of course in between and there might be very small characteristics that differ a little bit but overall they have the same characteristics on the kill zones so right here what do we see we see London expanding right there and this is important before 8 30 or around 8 30 right there we took these lows right there that indicates that a low resistance liquidity run has already happened right there in other words we already had a run on liquidity right there before coming into the am session so what you'll see right there is at 9 30 equities open and the opening range will likely be a consolidation some form of consolidation right there the reason being is because London and before 8 30 so before am session started we already achieved the objective the mission was already complete so am session is consolidating right there to generate new liquidity and what you'll generally see is that PM session then BM session will be an expansion and will be more volatile and that is exactly what we got right there how can we explain this in terms of the kill songs we just explained London expansion am consolidation again PM expansion but again like I said in the beginning as well these characteristics are general rule of thumb here how can we in terms of the A to Z guide as well and the structure we apply how can we view this intermediate term low got taken after that intermediate term low got taken at the right session right there this session could have also been a PM session and then I would have expected that PM session to consolidate some type of consolidation a bigger retracement into the intermediate term range premium right there and then we continue lower see how all these concepts are working in harmony the kill zones the structure everything is working in harmony so that intermediate turn low was our objective so once that gets taken before we have the most volatile session normally the am session then that could be a consolidation and then the PM session if this is a consolidation the PM session we know almost for certain it will have more movement than the am session so consistently I am giving you if then if we've reached the objective before a 30 likely consolidation if consolidation then PM session expansion there's constantly an if and then there's constantly an algorithmic Factor there's a mechanical guideline that is exactly why I always call it a step-by-step guide if you're paying attention and taking notes and I know most view are then it's no surprise that you're now seeing it is constantly in every every episode there's an if and then if and then if and then consistently you could make a song of it so on NASDAQ we had consolidation expansion consolidation here on ES we had expansion consolidation expansion now can you notice one last thing that I'm trying to tell here these hours the equities open the closing hour every single thing has certain characteristics as a general rule of thumb but based on liquidity look how fractal this is look how fractal we expect a lot of volatility to come into the market at closing hour right because closing hour you can see it as a take profit closing hour wants to take profit bonds are closing so it wants to take their profit right there the sort of as a London close so what do we see we take this intermediate term low this consolidates then we have a new intermediate term low right there we retrace creating a new protected High potentially if we now take out that new intermediate term row based on a structure video that we went over right here at closing hour where a lot of volatility comes into the market why did this consolidate this before closing hour we already took that intermediate term low right there so now the objective the same as the am session consolidation the objectives already complete you can apply this to every session see how fractal the market here is and can you now see also the am session Consolidated the PM session swept liquidity right there at equilibrium at premium of that range there could be an entry because in the PM session like I just mentioned on NASDAQ as well am session PM session indices in general they want to hunt liquidity first and then they take off so right there on the one minute what do we see we have an exact one minute entry right there and again reminder the reason I'm going into 1M on the indices is because the 1M on indices is way more doable to navigate than on Forex if you want to trade 1M if you want to be a scalper indices are your go-to instruments and that is what I have traded for a very long time so right here if you just apply the flood and a lot Concepts there's a very easy entry right there right you have this entry right there and then you also have that entry right there now let's look at one more example all right here we are on the daily on ES let's dive into this price action on the 15 minute so if we drop down into the 50 minute we were coming off of a daily survey Gap there as well now what do we see here right here we have we have a London consolidation right there and then it is very important to understand once you start trading the indices that at the am session if you want to be an AM session Trader am session first has a fake move and then the real move starts that is what happens a lot of the time so don't get faked by this fake move how would you not get faked by this fake move by understanding the higher time frame we were inside a daily for Vega AKA a discount so price will seek a premium in what form we have an order block right there on the four hour with most importantly this fair value gap on the four hour so if we drop back down into into the 15 minutes right here we see am session creates that low of the day in the opening range continues higher right there sweeping again liquidity a real liquidity Hunter now if you go into the lower time frame yourself right here that would be a great study going to the lower time frame right there and study how you could have gotten involved based off of the flood the lot all the stuff that has been taught to this day this is Thursday 1st of June on the es continuous contract then what do we see am expense and then in between here we already reach that premium array so we have already reached a target for that day so what happens BM session right there somewhat consolidates but the most important to understand it doesn't expand higher right there it consolidates and someone is in between if this was a candle it would have been a doge candle where you just have one small body and you have two long Wicks on both sides it is somewhat of a consolidation and you see a huge move down at the closing hour right there the volatility is there so right here if you do want to look at anything you would rather prefer shorts over Longs because we've already reached that Target that is important to understand so again there is an if then statement if PM session has already reached this and that then do this same for your am session if am session has already done this then that then do this consistently and you can see again consolidation expansion huge expansion consolidation the next day what do we see again London consolidation right there a big down move first and then we expand higher here you can see the difference 8 30 already had a big expansion up so when that happens 9 30 will still get a fake move down but it likely won't take out what 830 already established and then what do we see after PM session consolidation right there consolidation expansion consolidation or what also happens sometimes expansion consolidation expansion and that is also what we've talked about so go study this see how it applies to the market and as well remember if you're a Forex Trader or an industrator both Forex skill zones and innocent skill zones are important because the characteristics of these skill zones and these sessions they are very important to acknowledge and that is how we get the most potential out of you alright perfect thank you thank you
