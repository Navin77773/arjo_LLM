all right so we are going to be talking about swing projections how we can know the high and low of the day how we can know the high and low of a session how we can know the high and low of a week and how we can know the high and low of that particular month even so this is going to be a very strong tool that you can use now it is very important to understand that we first touched on the Judo swing and the power 3 the manipulation accumulation and distribution knowing that is very important because we know the Judas swing is that manipulation part of your power 3 right so all these episodes are in Harmony when you have that due to swing that Judas ring that manipulation part is exactly the part where you want to potentially draw your swing projections from so what do I actually mean by that or a session so where will a session likely reach or what can we actually talk Target well right here we have a London session the London session starts right there and it ends right there in between that London session what we touched on is you have a manipulation part accumulation part and you have a distribution all right from this part all that is moving down right here this swing why is that a swing well we are moving from That Swing High to That Swing Low this is a swing it is moving into a fair value Gap right there again using the flood and the lot first line of defense right there last line of defense right there a very logical move right there right so this Judas swing this manipulation part you would take your Fibonacci right there you draw it from That Swing Low right there to that swing High I'm sorry to interrupt the 0.62 you are seeing so the minus 0.62 that one is supposed to be 0.68 I messed it up with my Fibonacci settings and I noticed it in the edit so sorry about that it is supposed to be 0.68 all right let's continue then the Fibonacci settings are one to zero in between that you have nothing but on the minus side you have minus 0.27 minus 0.62 minus 1 a symmetrical swing point right there minus 1.62 and minus 2 a double symmetrical swing Point these levels is what price can reach for especially in this particular session right there what we would do here is you would want to make sure that you zoom out again you zoom out a little and right here you see all right we have a nice order block right there with verify Gap even potentially that high lining up with swing projections so when premium arrays Target right there are lining up with swing projections those are exactly what you want to Target so this is giving you a perfect indication of which premium arrays you want to Target so in this case we can use the order block right there the one the minus one level the symmetrical swing level that could be a great Earth take profit and afterwards if it does move aggressively through this we can now look to potentially aim for this level and that level and right here it reached even higher on this particular day now how can we know it reaches even higher right there we had this London session right here right now notice I am now drawing it from the bodies to the bodies not using the Wicks here and the reason for that is very much based off of volatility so how much do you expect the market to move and as well play around with it when you play around with this and you first go over the bodies then you go over using two weeks and you see which one of them is more aligning with premium or discount arrays so here I'm using the bodies right there from the London low to the London high and now I want to zoom out again and see which levels are overlapping with premium arrays alright a zoom out on a four hour can we see something yes right here what do we see we have a fair value Gap right there when you see this when you see these levels right there and you see that fair value gap on the four hour and overall of course the bias was still bearish can we now logically expect for it to reach into that -2 and then drop off it might happen but is it very logical of course not because we have a fair value Gap sitting right there and why do we use that Fairfax again first line of defense so right there all right we have an indication it can reach into that four hour five Gap so now we have somewhat of an indication what the sessions can reach for but what can the day actually reach for well if we go over the steps again so how can we know where to draw our measured swing projections we need to have first a judo swing or a manipulation part of that power three so right here the day opened right here midnight open that is your reference point everything above that that is your manipulation that is your Judas swing you draw it from this high to that low right there does this line up with a nice Target well first we have a few fair value gaps to start below that low of course there's a few fair value gaps to Target here this one and this one and then right here in between those two fair value gaps we have the 0.27 level so is there a chance that we will sting internet lower for that Gap yes there is there's a logical chance that that will happen and then at the right time of day because right here what happens London close starts if London close starts right there and we already reached into debt and we haven't displaced any lower and we already moved a lot of Pips so we already moved a lot of Pips up a lot of Pips down now we are arriving at London close right there which we know will likely cap the day based off of the daily profiles we talked about is it now logical to say we will continue lower until 0.62 not really yes it can happen but what you'll see is if we leave this one right there if we leave it on what happens 0.62 is perfectly overlapping with what this low right there which is also what the previous week low and a weekly fair value Gap alright that is a very logical Target for us so I think we might want to Target that but now we are getting closer to what we are getting closer to targeting something on a weekly so if we want to know what will we likely reach for on a weekly basis what do we use we just use daily profiles and daily power 3. now we want to use weekly power 3 and the weekly profiles so what is a weekly profile again remember Monday Tuesday Tuesday likely high of the week or Wednesday high of the week then you have the opposing move that is exactly what we want to see so from Monday where does Monday start AKA where is the week start right there the week starts Monday midnight open is is what I use right there so everything Above This level right there what is that that is your manipulation that is your power of three so this again you want to grab that Fibonacci too drawed from that high to that low again you can use the Wicks here see which one lines up nicely with a discount rate the bodies here you can see it already lines up it is not hindsight thing it just lines up better because there is a weekly verify Gap sitting right there so these right here is what you can use as targets the 0.27 first and then afterwards 0.62 and if there's a weekly verify Gap sitting right there previous week low as well is it now logical that we will reach for that symmetrical swing point right there but in my opinion it's not if we reach for that I believe we might even continue lower why is that well based on the weekly fair value gaps and based on the flood and the lot where will we likely continue higher off of off of that Weekly for fight so we will likely see a rejection there once we reach into that right there we reach into that Weekly verify Gap into that level on this Friday we have Thank God It's Friday setup what is the Judas swing on this Friday midnight open is right there low high symmetrical swaying point right there overlapping with what a beautiful one hour order block right there fair value Gap what more do you want so for a Thank God It's Friday setup that you potentially took right there what can the day what can Friday reach for also using this concept so now what is the next step or in your routine in your analysis your actual first step a monthly analysis so where does the month start here here we have Monday of May then we have this move up and we continue lower right there your Judo swing where is it your Judo swing in other words is your manipulation part of the power 3 where's your manipulation part of the power 3 on the monthly candle right there if we zoom out of course it is that part that Wick right so on The Daily it is everything that is above that Monday right there on the 1st of May so that right there is your duty swing where's your actual swing right there now for this month what does it line up with well first we line up with a few lows right there but what I always like is I like to aim for fair value gaps because you need to remember price is either taking liquidity or it is rebalancing something right here there's nothing to rebalance anymore because already everything has already been rebalanced so if there's nothing to rebalance what will it do it will take liquidity but when it takes liquidity what would likely do it will reach into something to rebalance after taking that liquidity so you could make the argument price is always rebalancing because after taking this liquidity what does it reach into that fair value and that is exactly what we had outlined in the weekly forecast leading up to this price action don't believe me watch the previous weekly forecast and you will exactly see what we were talking about during the month of May we exactly had this as our Target so for this may month we now now have this level overlapping with a beautiful rare value Gap right there and that's exactly what I would want to see a fair value Gap I I personally always love to Target Fair Value gaps so once I see this overlapping with a fair value Gap perfect that's it then what do we see after the next month where does it start May ends here alright June starts right there then we have this little down movement and then we continue a higher right there so this is our manipulation part right this is our Judas swing they're right there what do we see well first off we reach for that -2 level that doubles symmetrical swing right there but what do we reach for again a beautiful fair value Gap sitting right there on the daily which is also a fair value Gap right there on the weekly and even more refined there's an old block sitting right there that is exactly your monthly Target if you already have the monthly Target see how many days you are able to capitalize on it that is absolutely beautiful so for your swing projection you want to make sure that your swing projections are an indication of where price might reach for but the PD arrays will tell you exactly in combination with those swing projections what it will likely reach for because for example we also had this for Value right we also had that tiny fair value Gap right there and we did reach for it perfect but it is the 14th of June based on the power of three do you think the monthly candle will stop right there and then just consolidate doesn't make sense right it's only the 14th of June we're halfway through that month the meat is in the middle the same for a weekly candle right you wouldn't expect Wednesday to already make the opposing end of the week no the meat is in the middle that's where the trend is that is where we want to continue so that is very important to understand alright here we are on yes and I just want to go over the indices as well the future because it's a little bit different you don't use the same swing projections you use standard deviations what are standard deviations so if we again draw the Fibonacci and we draw it on this lag for example right there you would now have symmetrical swing points and half of that so it's constantly 0.5 0 to 5 added onto that minus one zero to five added onto that minus 1.5 and it stops at -3 this is your standard deviations why is this well that is because yes Futures in general indices are way more volatile so that is where you would use these standard deviations instead of the measured swing projections so for example why did I draw it on this leg down down well it's an obvious leg down of course but there's a reason behind it right here what do we see this is Monday Monday starts right there everything below that right there is your Judo swing for what or that Weekly profile so first off we have this lag Down AKA are due to swing on a weekly profile basis then right there we have a 0 to 5 level which already overlaps with fair value gaps right there that's what I love so this Tuesday reaches into that first and as a retracement but for the weekly profile it is only a Tuesday we are not done yet and after that we have Wednesday we have Thursday and Friday huge expansion higher reaching for 2.5 with of course an overlapping opposing premium array right there that is exactly what we would want to see and yes of course we could first have this Target in mind that fair value Gap right there with the symmetrical swing point right there but if we don't respect this if we don't show signs of respect aka the rejecting video that we touched on then what is the next thing that we can reach for that high now if we dive a little bit deeper into this we have this high this breaker block right there with an overlapping farewell Gap right there and now dropping down into the 15 minutes what do we see we first off have this Judo swing this fake move before you reach into that so this big move is already where you can draw your Fibonacci on right there almost symmetrical swing point but the main premise behind it again this is overlapping with what it's overlapping with that high right there that breaker block once we reach that what was the Judo swing leading into that move this right there what is this overlapping with that high right there so what is a logical Target that high once you get in here for example just keep in mind that we have that hype of course on the higher time frame we still have way more to aim for but if you're scalping on a one minute time frame is it logical to have a daily Target not really so if you sculpt this on the one minute time frame you might want to consider taking profits right there and getting break even now listen up you made it to the end so I'm here to reward you don't worry I'm looking out for you if you made it to the end I'm here to
