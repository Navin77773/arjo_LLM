you don't need a market structure shift if you are using fair value gaps that is exactly a tweet that I sent out recently and a lot of people don't seem to understand what I'm trying to say now the most viewed reversal pattern or the most huge entry pattern is waiting for a marked structure shift that is the most used in SMC or even in general in the trading industry now I want you to understand that this is my specialty this is my baby because this is the basis of order flow this is something we go very in depth on inside my mentorship and the money making team aka the mentorship members exactly know what I'm talking about I also want you to understand that this was not thought to me the basics of fair value Gap a mark structure shift was taught to me by ICT so for that part all credits to him this manner of looking at a reversal pattern where you don't need a market structure shift I discovered this through my own studies just like a lot of concept that I'm teaching in the A to Z guide and all the concepts that I'm using in the mentorship this was not taught to me by anyone this was taught to me by myself and the reason I emphasize on that is because it's very important that you can do the exact same you can also make discoveries like this if you just put in the work and you submit to time and you study your ass off you need to be self-sustainable you can't always rely on someone else especially not if you want to be successful so in order for us to enter without a mark structure shift let's actually look at what a mark structure shift is first now there are a lot of variables in the market structure shift itself but the basic premise behind a mark structure shift is when we come into a discount array for example that low right there the first and most recent swing high so that is that swing high in this case if we trade back above that that is exactly a market structure ship as we talked about in the advanced Market structure video as well that is a short term high that gets taken right there and what does that lead to that leads to now potentially creating an intermediate term low if you remember 2022 ICT mentorship entry model it is a market structure shift with displacement of course I'm naming the very basics of it but to Mark structure shift with a displacement where we need to displace above the swing high so Above That Swing High we would need to see a display what is displacement defined a displacement is a fair value Gap our value Gap equals displacement displacement equals fair value Gap if you don't know the ICT 2022 mentorship model don't worry now what I'm going to be teaching you here is my own SD model St stands for sharp turn my own St model I'm first going over the highest probability entry pattern and the highest probability reversal pattern that will suit you most likely but I will also go over where you only need one bullish for Value Gap and you don't actually need a mark struck to shift at all where you can enter before a mark structure shift on just one single bullish fair value Gap or bearish traffic only if you combine the time frames correctly so how can we enter without needing to look at that marked structure shift right there well we can ignore all this to the left the only thing I want you to do is pay attention to what's happening on the right side of your chart the only thing relevant is that discount array once we trade into that discount array the only thing relevant so we remove everything here the only thing relevant is if we are having bullish fair value gaps higher if we have one bullish fair value Gap higher and we trade back into a discount array that can either be the bullish for Value Gap itself or a breaker that's sitting right there and then we have a new bullish for Value Gap higher so that's two displacements in a row it's a mechanical order displacement retracement displacement that exactly that is your highest probability entry pattern what can you do after that you can use the concepts of the previous episode to get to an entry with an overlapping period so that could be off of that breaker right there covering that low right there and targeting the highs right there the Drone liquidity now why am I picking this in hindsight this is all hindsight why are you ignoring the fact that on the weekly forecast the free weekly forecast that I had done this Sunday the 9th of July on YouTube We called out this exact move this exact sweep and this exact move higher aiming for those highs right there so no this wasn't picked out in hindsight we called this exact move again displacement retracement displacement that retracement needs to be into a discount array if you're looking of course to buy and displacement a displacement equals for Vega for Vi Gap equals displacement this right here is my St model but that is not all we can go even more advanced here we are on Euro GBP we are coming into a daily premium array right there ignoring everything that's on the left the only thing relevant is that daily premium array and then when you dive into the lower time frame go into the lower time frame and only look at the right side of your chart where's your first marker structure shift let's first Mark that out your first Mark start to shift is here where is the method we are using the St model it is this right there and then we have a new displacement lower right there that is exactly your St model now right here you likely wouldn't have got an entry but like I just mentioned there's a more advanced method to entering if you combine the time frames correctly you can enter on the first bearish fair value Gap right there that right there is exactly how you can enter without needing a market structure shift and how we sometimes have crazy accurate entries like that very early engine a little reminder if you don't combine the time frames correctly the best entry setup will always be when we have displacement retracement so right there and then new displacement so this entry right there and then using the overlapping PD Ray or entering just off of that verify Gap whatever you prefer with combining the time frame if you can manage to do that through your own study it can lead you to not needing a mark structure shift and only needing that bearish for Value Gap to enter right there this is something we go very in depth on in the mentorship Overflow is like my baby if you've paid close attention you would have already seen this but on ES can you notice that we had the exact same entry as on Euro GBP right there on that fair value Gap even before we have the market structure shift even before we have that entry right there we could have already been in right there now how accurate is that entry for you is that enough do you need more and it's not rocket science it's a mechanical step-by-step guide that you have to follow just like everything that I'm teaching here it's an if then if bullish for Value Gap enter if displacement higher retracement into discount array displacement higher enter I'm constantly using mechanical guidelines it's not random it's not whatever fits my narrative this whole move was called out beforehand using the concept that I'm teaching can you notice how beautifully practical that is now what is the logic with the method here with the SD model that I'm teaching why an SD model over just your Market structure shift well the SD model again it is two rules combined into one it is easier and it is stronger and the logic behind it is if price is ran by some sort of algorithm by financial institutions by Banks Etc and they have huge or orders what will happen in price price will displace price will displace what is displayed in again a fair value Gap price will show fair value gaps when we are coming off a premium or discount array price will show fair value gaps because the orders are so huge price will leave behind inefficiencies so what is more important the inefficiencies the fair value gaps or a marked structure shift the fair value gaps are the most important fair value gaps tell you the story and the fair value gaps telling you the story is exactly what we will go over as well in the next video on Friday it is not that market structure shift that's telling you a story it might be a Confluence but the main story is being told by the fair value gaps not the marks truck to shift alright USD Canadian dollar right here now the line you are seeing right there is a four hour premium array so why didn't I take this trade right there again you need context everything that you're doing you need context behind it so as well the reversal pattern that we're talking about here is of course fractal so the same reversal pattern can be applied on the higher time frame the St model is not only for your load time frame it is as well suitable for the higher time frame it can lead to your bias the SD model can lead to your bias we wait for that premium rate right there to be tapped into we tap into it right there now again ignoring everything that is to the left the only thing we need to see is a bearish vervi gap right there we have a potential bearish wagon there it is confirmed so what you would now do is you would Scout your marked execution on the on your other screen or wherever you have it on your phone maybe wherever your Market execution is ready to execute when we come into that fair value Gap all right we don't trade back into it but we have a new fair value Gap to work with so you would enter on this fair value Gap right there marked execution ready to execute on that fair value Gap we sting into that for Value Gap where's your stop loss above the potential intermediate term High targeting the future drone liquidity right there and that is my St model and you can notice right here where was your markstruct shift your mark start shift was right there again if you like this and this already blows your mind then come see what we have in store for you inside the mentorship because that will truly blow your mind how we are able to use this how we have already racked up 950k assets under management in four months four months of the mentorship being live and I don't want to take full credit for that because it is my students it is you it is everyone that is watching that is putting their trust in me and that is working their ass off so it's not me it's you that's making it work so thank you for that I owe you thank you thank you thank you for your support thank you for your trust this is only the beginning of order flow that you're seeing right here now if you like using the market structure shift then please go ahead and use it but I believe you are doing yourself a disservice by not using the SD model it makes life so much easier way more accurate higher probability what more do you want next on Friday we have the topic how fair value gaps tell story going even more in depth but if you want more advanced insights again the mentorship is the place to be perfect thank you [Music] thank you [Music]
