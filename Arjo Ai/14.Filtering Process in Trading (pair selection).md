inter-market analysis correlated assets how can we choose the best pair or the best instrument to trade that is exactly what we are going to be touching on here today inside my mentorship we have something called the filtering process now the filtering process is even more in-depth but right here I will show you the basics of it which is very crucial to get to an instrument to get to a pair that you want to trade most gloss enrollments open up tomorrow and they close again on Monday so that is next Monday to open up on 17th of June and they close again at the end of Monday so that is 19th of June in July enrollments will not open up again so if you want to be there be there now so intermarket analysis how can we actually get started with it and what actually is it I like to view it as a fundamental view of the entire market so you know you have a brief idea of what the entire Market is doing this way we take into account as well interest rates Etc on a technical basis but also on a fundamental basis now we get our fundamental analysis off of the chart so we don't need to look at news releases at the economic data we can get all the data all the fundamental data that we need through the chart that is absolutely beautiful and there is a very interesting part of trading as well so let's start off with how should the market actually move of course it will not always move like this but this is the highest probability if the market moves like this then that is the highest probability condition that you will have in the market right here you can see we are on the ticker zb1 that is the continuous contract The Continuous future contract of the 30-year treasury bond the 30-year treasury bond is the one I will be referring to mostly you also have the 10 year treasury month and a 5 year 30 month but we are going to be focusing on a 30-year treasury bond right here so for the 30-year treasury bond it is important to understand that the 30-year treasury bond is inversely correlated to the dollar so this will likely do the opposite of the dollar and if the dollar is going higher then what does that mean interest rates are going higher inflation is rising so the bonds are decreasing if the bonds are going higher interest rates are dropping the dollars going lower inflation is dropping so they are inversely correlated now sometimes you will see especially in this year we have had a lot of consolidation inside the 30-year treasury bond when this happens it usually is decoupled from the dollar what does this mean decoupled decoupled means when two correlated assets are not moving as they should be so they are not in sync anymore if the dollar is going higher bonds should be going lower when this isn't happening and the bonds are going higher and the dollar is going higher as well they are decoupled there's no sink in the market there's no coupling this already indicates a lower probability condition and that we might see a Seek and Destroy condition again seek in the short conditions and trending conditions is something we will get in to as well now what this indicates is usually that there is some consolidation coming when we have a decoupled market sooner or later there will be some form of consolidation now how can we actually know this beforehand by the seek and historic conditions and that again is something we will get into and of course if you thought this through then if these markets are decoupled and the bonds are moving higher and we are expecting higher price of the bonds because we do our analysis first on the bonds and then afterwards we also go into the dollar and we are also on a technical standpoint we are also expecting a higher price on the dollar then what does that indicate 50 50 bias you can't get to a clear draw liquidity when the markets are decoupled and that is also a low probability conditions is also something we will get into so just more of the story right here if the fonts are moving a higher dollar should be moving lower ideally if the bonds are moving lower dollar should be moving higher now what does this indicate for the rest of the market let's talk about Forex so foreign currencies every currency besides the US dollar if the US dollar is moving higher the foreign currencies should be moving lower they are also inversely correlated why is this dollar is the world Reserve currency everything currently is based around the dollar it has a lot of influence it is currently the biggest economy now of course with how the world is changing Etc that might change at a certain point I think China is catching up as well but again that is not that relevant currently and indices as well they are moving opposite of the dollar so also inversely correlate so bonds higher dollar lower foreign currencies higher inices higher that is the general rule of thumb now just to give you a quick insight into what I do when the bonds are consolidating and they have been consolidating a lot throughout the year I do tend to take the bonds less into account so I will mainly go over the dollar and then the foreign currencies or the indices those are still very important but the bonds have been consolidating quite a while throughout this year and that may explain price action throughout the year as well because when this happens it is still lower probability and if you wear around in last summer this price action was absolutely beautiful almost at the end of the summer going into the fall we had beautiful price action because the inter-market analysis agreed everything was moving in Harmony and when this happens you have very high probability price action all right now that we understand the basic premise behind in the market analysis how can we actually use this to our advantage well if we do an analysis ahead of the day ahead of the month ahead of the week I like to use intermarket analysis to get a basic view of the market because if I'm expecting the bonds to move lower so when I go into the dollar I have something that I want to be looking for ideally I want to look for higher prices if the bonds are going lower and of course vice versa this already makes it a lot easier when everything is agreeing it makes it so much easier you won't get blindsided essentially so inside the mentorship like I already mentioned we have a filtering process says this filtering process also has sort of an order of proceeding now like I mentioned when the bonds for example right here are consolidating I like to head to the dollar instead so here we are on the dollar and then I like to take a look at higher Turf and look at what the dollar is doing when I can get to a clear draw on liquidity on the dollar then that already tells me a lot about what Forex pairs want to potentially do and what indices potentially want to do so for example here let me take you through my analysis right here this is currently a Friday this is today if this candle now closes what do we see we create a daily fair value Gap right there what could happen next week we could see a potential sting into that daily for Value Gap and then a continuation on Lower previous day high sweep Etc and then we could Target this liquidity pool right there so again not Financial advice this might not happen at all so do your own analysis and if your analysis is different from mine then stick to your own analysis so right here if I'm expecting lower prices on the dollar then if we take a look at other pairs like foreign currencies so let's head over to them here we have EU Euro US dollar Euro of course foreign currency so this already tells me a lot of what my drone quality will likely be on EU then we have this liquidity pool right there and we have also the same scenario as in the daily verify Gap so you can see how this is already in harmony now of course if we take a look at gu gu is in the exact same situation but there is a minor difference can you notice the difference between the smt pair that we had established in the previous episode we had gu and EU if we are trading gu you would use EU as your smt pair and a fisa versa so in that case which one of those pairs which you buy and this is relative strength because if we take a look right here you can already tell probably this same high on EU has not yet been taken out and if we take a look at the move that happened from here to here this is a bigger and more explosive move than what happened on EU so this pair aka the currency Great British pound is stronger and relatively stronger than Euro so in that case you would want to buy Great British pound AKA gu so if we now repeat the steps of smt in the previous episode we came into some form of discount array because if we're now looking for high prices we are coming into some form of discount array then when we are waiting for confirmation we look for smt so whether the breaker or the swing failure happens in gu we already know that is irrelevant because we want to buy gu because on a higher timeframe basis and remember High atar famous where the orders are on a higher timeframe basis gu is stronger it is relatively stronger so that is the pair that we want to buy that is the currency that we want to buy now again if you are a complete beginner I always advise people to focus on one pair and focus on one pair only and master that pair and then eventually when you feel like you are limiting yourself then you can apply the filtering process that we use in a mentorship and then you can take it a more advanced route if you are not comfortable with that yet then I would always advise stick to one pair stick to one instrument whether that's es or EU or gu or even USD JPY stick to that pair and master that one first that will also test your patience Etc so then like we mentioned in the previous episode on smt as well then you don't have to worry about which pair am I buying which instrument am I buying etc etc so if we flip it around right if we take a look and maybe we expected the dollar to go higher then the whole situation would change because right here gu is relatively stronger but if we then take a look at EU again we can see EU was weaker so if we were looking for cells we would want to sell Euro so then it flips around right it's just vice versa if we were looking for cells we would want to sell Euro US dollar instead of GBP US dollar now how does this apply to the indices right here I'm on the continuous contract of es we can see es has been pretty strong if we take a look at NASDAQ you could tell between the smt pairs between es NASDAQ NASDAQ has been even stronger than es so if you were looking for pies then you would look at NASDAQ why it is relatively stronger it has more potential to go higher now of course there's one more smt pair between the indices and that is ym AKA The Dao now we can already tell right here the Taoist apps salute the weakest between the smt pairs on the indices so ideally I would not want to focus on bias on the Dow I would want to focus on ideally NASDAQ buys and then if es price delivery is a little bit cleaner then I would move to es buys but I would want to avoid the Dow buys of course that changes if you are focused on the Dow as your primary instrument to trade because you are not ready for that filtering process just yet then don't worry you can also just buy the Dow but again if we expected the dollar to go higher then the whole story would change we would look for lower prices on the Dow and then the Dao is the weakest it is relatively weaker than NASDAQ and then yes so I would prefer cells and shorts on the Dow instead of es and NASDAQ so when you go over this and price action also agrees so you have lean price action you have that clean marked structure that we talked about you have to clean plot the clean a lot you have fair value gaps to work with then you have an extremely powerful filtering process at your disposal so what I would love for you to do is if you go over this filtering process and you compare a few instruments a few Pairs and see which one is stronger see which one is weaker and compared with the dollar as well it's a dollar going highest dollar going lower again this can be all data this can be all in hindsight whatever you feel like and see where you had the opportunities to get in potentially using smt on the lower time frame and then see which one had the most explore closed captioning not available [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]
