today I'm going to teach you a strategy that you can use and you don't need a daily bias all you need is a one hour time frame or whichever time frame you want to use you can get very creative with the time frames you need structure the structure that we already talked about but this Friday I will go again more in depth on structure just to reinforce the ID once you understand structure and you understand time the exact things we are going to talk about today you don't need much more this is going to be about indices but again this strategy itself can also be applied to Forex the main difference between indices and Forex is that indices have a very specific time frame where the volatility comes in during the day Forex of course also has kill zones but for any sys Equity is open is like it's Mayhem it's crazy so if you want to narrow down your focus to one specific moment on the day then the equities open might just be for you or which Forex doesn't have any still has a lot of volatility at the end of the day so at the PM session that is when Forex already dies down most of the time now I want to go over this strategy again disclaimer don't just blindly use this first go over all the episodes in the A2Z guide and make sure that you understand the basis of these strategies and in this case the basis is structure structure is your guide in this strategy ahead of time I will tell you I will tell you the exact steps that I'm using I'm using the one hour time frame on the one hour time frame I'm using intermediate term highs and intermediate term lows and in between that of course short-term highs short-term lows then I'm using time to my advantage I will exactly explain what I mean with that and then once we hit a one hour PD array I go into the one minute or the 5 min that is up to you both can be used because like I mentioned you can get very creative with the time frames if we take a look at es right here on the one hour time frame what are we seeing in last week's price action well right here on this Friday we have an intermediate term high sitting right there again intermediate term highs intermediate term lows Market structure in general next video is again where I will reinforce the ID of Mark structure but that is an intermediate term high that intermediate term high should hold ideally right if we are going lower the intermediate term High could not get violated with violated I mean it should not get disrespect so again that leads me back to the video that I had on Fair Value gaps are telling you a story then once we retrace right there we retrace into premium of that intermediate term range we come back into that for that Gap and then we slowly start displacing lower we have new fair value up slower then this strategy is mainly about equities open and PM session I personally don't like London session for indices if you are going to trade indices you might want to take a look at Ducks because that is one of the instances that is very volatile during London but es NASDAQ ym I would personally only look at them during New York sessions so what we notice here on this Monday we already displayed slower we display slower than on Tuesday London session we also displays lower then what do we see the obvious drone liquidity is what it's this low right it's that intermediate term load that is our first Target right in between this high right there and that low this area is where your short-term highs will start to hold that is where the St model will form and once that SD model forms that is exactly when the short-term highs will hold and they will hold until when until we reach that Target after we reach that Target what happens again we could see a bigger retracement so what is the next high that should hold it's the intermediate term height that got created right here that intermediate some high that is our context from this point right there this point until that point that is where we want to get involved after we take that Target we don't want to get involved anymore and we would want to wait we want to wait until we see something new at the right time so let me go over what I mean with that if that again let me Mark the Target right there that is our Target at the right time Equity is open 9 30 you can also start trading at 8 30. I have one specific rule for that if 8 30 the same as the Asia expansion what we talked about on the Forex strategies which is why every strategy I'm explaining is very important to understand and every video in the HD guide is very important because if 830 already comes into your PD rain already this place is lower or displaced away from the PD Ray then 930 will likely not take out whatever 830 already created the same with your London Killzone when Asia already expanded away from the PD array that's the same premise for the 830 and 930 rule so write that down I'll explain it one more time if a30 comes into the PD Ray and already displays away from the pity Ray so that's fair value gaps moving away from the PD array then 930 will likely not take out whatever a30 created this exact same with your Asia expansion so what do we notice on the one hour we have this rare value Gap right there that is exactly what we would want to see that is our fair value Gap close to the drama credit with you so do we expect a retracement all the way back to an overlapping PD Ray and then we continue lower not necessarily like we explained in the verify Gap videos and they're right there time will exactly tell us into which pdra it wants to sting into before continuing lore now what do I mean by that let me Define that with time I mean kill zones so that is your a30 as your 930 that is your London Kill Zone that is your New York am session your New York PM session when these skill zones start they will have a fake move but that fake move is not that relevant it's just a move into a premium array if we are continuing lower that Killzone will move into a premium array then it will show on the lower time frame and entry pattern when that entry pattern shows itself that is where you can get involved and you can Target the Drone liquidity why do I say time will tell you into which pdra you want to stick into and for from where it wants to continue lower because at that time is where the entry pattern will form it won't form earlier than that let me show you why if we now drop down into the one minute time frame here we are on the one minute time frame and what we can see is that this one hour for Value Gap is what we are working with so when we come into that one hour PD array at the right time so at a Kill Zone and then after that we have our entry pattern now I will explain two type of Entry patterns on a one minute what you want to see is if you're using one hour PD race you want to have a one minute fair value Gap lower then after that another one minute fair value Gap lower and once you have that second fair value Gap lower that is exactly when you want to get involved and what I mean with using the time frames very creative is if you go up in time frames and you use a five minute entry pattern then you only need one five minutes per Vega which you could enter off of so for example right here at 923 we sting into that one Upper Valley Gap did a30 already displays lower from a PD Ray no it did not so we're waiting for 9 30 to come into that PD Ray it does right there just ahead of 9 30 so there's nothing there yet then afterwards we have a sting again into the premium Ray at 9 30 and then we continue lower we have one further Gap the second fair value Gap sitting right there premium arrays already getting respected right there that is very important then this right there could already be your entry what do you cover you can cover that high why that high that is a short term high that should hold until we reach the target of this intermediate term low so that right there that is your Target that is a one to two in what in 10 minutes in not even 10 minutes that is is crazy there is one way of entering so if we follow the intermediate term highs right here the intermediate term highs again let me Mark them out again they are telling us that price wants to continue lower because structure is bearish right there so just based off of the one hour intermediate term highs we can see that structure is bearish so price is telling us it wants to go lower now a little Golden Nugget for you if you want to be even more accurate you can use daily PD Rays because the one hour is your guide towards daily PD race the price wants to reach into so right here what do we see again on this Thursday right there at the right time we come into that high we are sweeping high now this is when I tell you again time will tell you into which premium array it wants to stick into because beforehand could we have known that it wants to sweep those highs and then continue lower no we don't know but when that does happen when at the right time an equity is open right there it stinks into that high and sweeps it and then on a lower time frame we have an entry opportunity we react we don't sit still we react and we see all right it's sweeping we want to get involved right there because time exactly will validate the right premium array time will use the right primary and after it reaches into the primary then you will have your entry pattern so if we dive into the five minute right there so this is your five minute time frame and you can see that at 9 30 we push higher and this is your swing high right there we are sweeping and why are we sweeping it the fair value gaps are telling us a story again we have an immediate rejection lower where value gaps lower bullish for Vegas are not getting respected then we have one verify Gap sitting right there that could already be an entry opportunity but it doesn't sting into that alright perfect we have a new fair value Gap lower right there so we enter off of that and once we enter off of that further again we cover again the swing high right there that is your short term high with the same exact target the target being that intermediate term load that we had established on the one hour time frame because we're just following one hour structure so one hour structure is our guide then time will tell us into which premium array or discount array it wants to sting into then we use a one minute or a five minute entry pattern and remember the difference one minute two fair value gaps five minutes you only need one verify Gap now again I want you to either choose the one minute or the five minutes don't use both for your entry pattern either choose one minute or the five minutes now when can you actually go break even on this trade there is also something we will go more in depth on later on but you go break even also based on structure structure and displacements that will tell you exactly when to go break even using the short term highs right there now is this a trading strategy ready for you to use immediately yes it is it is for sure will you be successful with it from the first moment on no and don't put that pressure on yourself to be successful with a trading strategy from the get-go because that's very rare in the mentorship we always discuss a losing curve there's a mandatory losing curve you have to take losses first when you get used to a new trading strategy it's mandatory it always happens to every single one because you're getting used to a new trading strategy but the importance is you need to stick to it stick to the same exact strategy or a long period of time and see the results you will be mind blown doing the boring thing over and over the same strategy that is where your win rate will increase and your return will increase significantly but if you're using a new strategy every single week you will not see any results I can promise you that and again the reason why I'm sharing multiple trading strategies is of course we have different personalities so pick one you like I'm giving you inspiration here and then run with it and like I mentioned you can get very creative with the time frames because you can also use 50 minute structure and if you want to make it even higher probability you can also incorporate a higher time frame 3D race that way you can build onto the trading plan but don't overwhelm yourself because this core the core of this strategy is all you need you don't need some kind of weird New Concept this is all you need so please never never forget that then and on Friday again a very important Market structure video so be there and if you haven't watched the Forex strategies just yet I would highly advise to watch them as well it's the one right here on your screen and you can go to it alright perfect thank you [Music] thank you
