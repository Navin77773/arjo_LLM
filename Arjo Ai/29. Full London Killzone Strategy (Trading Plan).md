a full trading plan using a London Kill Zone that is exactly what we're going to talk about today we are going to talk about two scenarios because there's two variables to it first we have an Asia expansion and we have an Asia consolidation both Rivals is exactly what we're going to go over we're going to start off with the Asia expansion so let me guide you through this price action right here on EU on the free weekly forecast actually we mentioned this fair value Gap right there on EU we came into it right there then if we drop down into the four hour on Wednesday we had a bearish fair value Gap right there and we had this order block sitting right there now what you might notice this is the exact same setup is that we mentioned in the turtle soup video the only thing different is the entry pattern the only thing you are doing on the lower time frame is you you are getting in sync with price on the higher time frame that's all you're doing the hard work is done on the higher time frame so if we move from that premium array on the four hour dead or the block what is our Target our Target is this swing low on the four hour that is your discount rate premium rate to Discount array so we dive into the five minutes and here we can see that Asia right there is already in the premium array and Asia already expands lower whenever this happens that is perfectly fine on your entry time frame right there if Asia already has bearish fair value caps that is perfectly fine so Asia right there is a bearish Vegas right there very sure if I get right there going low as well and London opens up right there right there all I need to see in London is a new bearish fair value Gap then I enter on the overlapping PD array right there where is my bearish survival Gap in London right there where's the overlap in PD Ray it is right there that right there is my entry this is actually very similar to my own trading plan where would the stop loss go well would stop loss go above that high no it would not why not well you have to take into account the time frames above it like we always mentioned the time frame you are trading on needs to be in context of the time frame above it five minute needs to be in concert with the 50 minute is there something on the 15 minute Affair value gap or whatever hovering above that high there's a 15 minute fair value Gap sitting right there and it's a one hour fair value Gap as well so does price have a reason to come back there yes it has so what would you do in that case you cover these highs price has no reason to come back there which on the 5 minutes is this intermediate term high right there now what was your target again it was that four hour low so that right there is your your target a super nice little trade on a Thursday a 1-3 perfect and afterwards you even have another entry because you have that re-entry right there that is another entry and now you can cover this new intermediate term high that is in the making right there targeting the same exact low right there which is an intermediate term low on the 5 minute time frame which was just that simple for our Target you might think Hmm this is too simple this is too easy can it be this simple yes it can this is all you need this is your AMD your power 3 your midnight open your new week opening Gap your Enigma everything that you need is involved in just this simple trading plan the only thing is you are not paying attention to it and you don't need to so this is the variation of the Asia expansion now let's go over the classic London setup just to give you some context it's important to understand right here that on gu we hadn't reached that high just yet which was our draw on liquidity so if we go into the four hour right there and we look at this for our fair value Gap that right there is a short opportunity until we reach that drone liquidity with the first Target being that low and then the second target of course being that drone liquidity this is actually a trade that a few members inside the money making team inside the Discord actually caught so if we now go into the five minute time frame right there London starts right here again what do we need in London we need bearish fair value gaps being created in London itself when we come into that premium array again right there we have the first bearish River Gap and you wait for a second bearish fair value Gap so you have a first bear Gap and you wait for a second one we trade into the first one and then we have a second bearish fair value Gap that is again your SD model then that right there that is your entry governing the intermediate term High targeting what targeting the exact same Target that for our swing low that is already a one to four that is perfect and this is where Asia is in consolidation but again Asia being consolidation or an expansion is not even relevant it of course it's somewhat relevant but this being a consolidation or an expansion is not a big deal we have mechanical guidelines to getting involved right there this is your London strategy again your midnight open your power 3 your AMD your Macros every fancy concept you need your Reaper whatever you want to call it everything is involved here but you're not paying attention to it and that is the beauty you can do the exact same with daily PD race only daily PD race you would not use the five minute entry time frame you would go up in time frames that is very important to understand now this trading plan particularly the London trading plan I would advise to focus on Forex pairs you can trade it for innocence but I will have a different trading strategy for indices as well and if you're a New York Trader then I will also have a New York strategy so follow along with the ATZ guide and those videos will come no worries now if you're interested in more of this and the exact mechanics behind it then the mentorship might be something for you link is in the description or visit oreo.io and if you're not sure on how I developed this trading plan then I would highly advise you to check out this video which is another video in the A2Z guide which will tell you everything you need to know alright perfect thank you thank you thank you
